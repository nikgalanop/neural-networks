When her husband returns she insists on leaving, and so they do. The couple arrives at a house where the husband apparently grew up. This is where the rest of the story unfolds. The wife sees the woman from the hotel in the woods on the property but she does not tell her husband. Susan notices in the house that there are paintings up of male ancestors but none of the wives. She is told by the servants' daughter that the wives' paintings are in the cellar. Susan notices that one of the paintings of the wives has the face cut out of it. Susan's husband tells her that the woman in the painting is named Mircalla Karnstein, one of his ancestors, who two hundred years before murdered her husband on their wedding night because he supposedly made her commit unspeakable acts. Susan has violent dreams involving the mysterious woman she has been seeing. She wakes up and finds a dagger under her pillow. At his point, Susan starts to become detached from her husband. The husband calls on a doctor to figure out why she is having all of these dreams and what is wrong with her.

He questions his sister and brother-in-law, as well as two ex-comrades in an attempt to connect the dots. He finds out that he was sent home the previous night in a car by Zhou Xiaogang . Ma knocks on Zhou's door but is greeted by Li Xiaomeng , Ma's former lover who married and moved to Guangzhou, but has since returned. Li claims that Zhou is not home.

During his search, Ma comes across a thief who has snatched a woman's handbag and gives chase. The desperate thief, seeing no escape, pulls out a gun. Mistaking the gun for his own, Ma refuses to back down. The thief fires, only to reveal that the gun he holds is a fake. Meanwhile, a murder has taken place in town.

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

            "In Tokyo, during an evening get-together with friends, Okazaki Yoko's  cell phone suddenly rings in an eerie, unusual tone, cartoon styled. Not recognizing the tone, Yoko doesn't pick up soon enough and the call goes into \"voice mail\" . When she sees that the call/message was from her own phone number and dated two days into the future, both she and her friend Nakamura Yumi  listen intently to the message. What they hear is the voice of Yoko in casual chit-chat, followed by a horrendous scream and then dead silence, which visibly disturbs Yoko and Yumi. The two girls attempt to laugh the message off and even share the story with their friends, who are just as clueless as them. She tells her friends that she received the call to her cell phone on Apr 16 at 11:04 p.m. Her cell phone indicated that the message was from Apr 18 at 11:04 p.m. At exactly 11:04 p.m. on April 18, Yumi receives a call from Yoko. During that call, Yoko goes through the very same chit-chat as was on her previous voice mail. As Yumi suddenly realizes what might happen next, she hears Yoko shriek into the phone. Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko's severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji's  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi's house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi's feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi's phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi's apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi's reflection in nearby mirror, it's Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she'll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to \"take care of\" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.\n",

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney.

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

            "A research team, including Joanne , Damon , Gary  and Phil , deploy small UAVs from a C130 Hercules, to interfere with a storm. At first the group celebrate a good result, however a large storm begins to develop. Meanwhile, Charlie , an ex-scientist, is in town to promote his new book, with his assistant Nora  in the  town of Harrisford, Oregon. As Charlie does a book signing at a local book shop, the storm hits the town. Charlie and Nora narrowly escape death; however, the storm kills many others. Just outside town, a young couple Eric  and Ashley  are traveling to meet with Charlie as part of their university course. Eric notices a strange weather pattern however Ashley takes no notice, as she is in a rush to get to the book signing. In town, Nora is taken to hospital for injuries while Charlie meets up with his old friend Joanne and also Damon, who have rushed to the scene after their computers detected the storm. Joanne wishes to stop the program and so orders Damon to phone their backer Frank . However Frank tells Damon he will not stop the experiment until it has been completed and so allows the small UAVs to continue flying. Meanwhile, another storm freezes a farmer. Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the scene where they discover one of the UAVs that has crashed. Joanne tells Charlie about the experiment. Nora then phones Charlie. She is leaving town for the TV show Charlie has an appearance on later that day. Meanwhile, Eric and Ashley arrive at the book signing to discover it has finished and begin to leave town. Charlie, Joanne and Damon travel back to their experiment site, where they meet up with Gary and Phil. Charlie comes up with a theory of how the UAVs are causing the storms, and Damon tells Joanne Frank has not aborted the experiment. Angrily, Joanne phones Frank to warn him, but Frank rejects her calls. As Eric and Ashley leave town, a tornado forms. Nora's car is hit by debris. After the tornado disappears, Eric and Ashley walk back to town. At the experiment site, another tornado hits. The group flee but Phil is killed. They go to a nearby hotel where they discover Frank has blocked them from deactivating the UAVs. Eric and Ashley break into a building where they decide to change their presentation to the freak weather after Eric caught it on camera. The group come across wreckage where they discover Nora's body. A furious Joanne blames Damon for not making Frank finish the experiment. As Charlie mourns Nora's death, another storm hits, forcing the group to flee. After a plane that Frank sent into the sky crashes, he wishes to deactivate the UAVs; however, Bill  informs him they are not responding. The group travel to the same building Eric and Ashley are at, and Gary begins to try and deactivate the UAVs. They realize the storms will reach populated areas very soon and warn Frank, who allows the UAVs to be destroyed. However, the storm continues to grow despite the UAVs having been destroyed. While Eric and Ashley send out signals to warn people, Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the university to use its satellite to punch a hole in the ozone layer to extinguish the storms. While arriving, Damon is killed by large hailstones. Meanwhile Gary manages to connect to a satellite in space. The plan works and the storms are extinguished. Eric and Ashley help Charlie and Joanne put Frank in prison for manipulating the team into creating a weapon.\n",

            "The film is a contemporary  picture that takes place in New York City. The story involves a mad scientist who turns circumstances on a young man to do his bidding. Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "The film begins by depicting the fabled tale of how the gypsies came to be. According to folklore gypsies are descendants of an Egyptian pharaoh. In the film, actors are dressed in ancient Egyptian costumes as they dance to flamenco music. As the story continues, the gypsies are run out of their lands and are forced to live nomadic lives, stealing and thieving as a means to survive. The Monty Pythonesque history lesson then continues to present the protagonists’ ancestors and the scene that drives the rest of the film: Trinidad’s  ancestor places a spell on Enrique’s  ancestor that will cause his descendant to fall in madly in love with her descendant. The story continues to the present day, that is to say the 1950s, where Trinidad and her uncle Regalito  are charged with stealing six hams from a shop window. This scene presents some of the most entertaining banter in the entire film as Trinidad and Regalito argue their innocence with very matter-of-fact language and mannerisms common to Andalusian gypsies. Their witty mockery, while creating uproars of laughter from the courtroom audience, causes the judges to grow more infuriated with the pair. It is then that Enrique, a lawyer, steps in to defend Trinidad and Regalito. After much deliberation, the two gypsies, after having to pay a fee, are set free. The fee they are required to pay forces Trinidad to find employment. Coincidentally, she finds a job as a maid in Seville at the home of Enrique, the lawyer. Instead of dismissing Trinidad, Enrique decides to make her part of an experiment he plans to conduct. His experiment is to see if he can turn Trinidad from a thieving gypsy into a functioning member of Spanish society. He plans to track change in his Pygmalion-like experiment by playing a song and seeing how she reacts to it. The more refined she becomes, the less she should react to the folkloric music. Trinidad’s reaction to Enrique’s statement, while humorous, presents the moral of the story: she tells him that the spirit of a gypsy is something that no one can tame and that, even though she will try because he has asked her to do this for him, it is an impossible task. Fitted with new, modern clothing, Trinidad’s reaction to the music is a romping performance full of beautiful arm movements and earth-shaking stomps.<ref nameHU3e9MRSexo YouTube-Morena Clara] Trinidad’s performance is so spell binding that, not only is Enrique entranced, but her impromptu tune is so catchy that he hums along to it the very next morning. As the months go by, Enrique’s experiment grows more futile as Trinidad’s charisma wins him over. As Enrique’s coworker sees how entranced he has become by her, he plots to convince Trinidad to leave with the pretense that Enrique’s career might be jeopardized by her presence in his household. Trinidad instantly decides to leave as the last thing she wants to do is hurt Enrique. She makes the decision to say goodbye to him by performing a song dedicated to him. In an emotionally driven performance, Trinidad performs a powerful rendition of “Te Lo Juro Yo,”<ref name6oLZ62z4RHo&feature=related YouTube-Te Lo Juro Yo], quickly leaving as soon as the song is done. In the end, Enrique tracks down Trinidad and declares his love for her.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

Arden gets into a fight with her mother, which compels her to finally leave home. Arden has her date with Rudy. In the morning, Arden calls the police to report a woman  left alone at home. *The Sister: Leah is prepping the dead woman in the morgue when she notices a certain birthmark.

The sheriff delivers the test result: the dead woman is NOT Jenny. *The Wife: Ruth is angry that her husband, Carl, constantly leaves her alone night after night. The next morning, she discovers clothing, wallets, and ID's in ziplock bags inside a storage unit that is supposedly empty. She matches the IDs to names in the newspapers of the serial killer's victims. Carl comes back late at night with scratches on his neck.

Melora, Krista's mother, is notified. Melora goes to Krista's previous house and finds Rosetta, Krista's former roommate. During a tense conversation with Rosetta, Melora learns that her daughter Krista had been a prostitute, that she bore a daughter, and that Melora's late husband had sexually abused her own daughter Krista.

One of her johns, Tarlow, promises to drive her to Norwalk, where her daughter is, but he backs out at the last minute.

When the motorcycle breaks down on the highway, Krista hitches a ride from Carl. The film ends with Krista smiling, and happily talking about her daughter.\n",

            "It is 1940. When the movie begins, film star Viviane Denvert sits in the audience of a premiere of her new movie and notices a man who keeps staring at her. She is disturbed, and when the film is over and the audience has finished praising her, she rushes home, discovering that she is pursued by that same man. He chases her into her apartment. An hour later, Frédéric Auger, a young writer, receives a call from Viviane, who was his childhood crush. Viviane, who has long used Frédéric's devotion, asks him to come to her apartment immediately. Upon arriving, he discovers a corpse, \"accidentally\" killed, which Viviane asks him to dispose of, claiming that the man had been harassing her and when she slapped him, he had fallen over the edge of the balcony. He agrees to help her and the two pack the corpse into the trunk of his car; however, as it is raining, he accidentally drives into a curb and hits a police signalling device . The trunk opens upon impact, revealing the dead body to the arriving police and so, Frederic is arrested and sent to prison. On the eve of the German occupation of Paris, all of the city's citizens evacuate, including the prisoners. Prisoners are paired up with another and hand cuffed together. Frédéric and his cellmate Raoul take advantage of the confusion to escape. Frédéric then takes the train to Bordeaux, where he learns that Viviane is. It so happens that Raoul is also on the train and he leads Frederic to a seat near another girl, Camille. Camille turns out to be a student of a physics professor; the two of them are guarding French stocks of heavy water that they must ship to England before the Germans can get their hands on it and create an atomic bomb. The remainder of the film traces the confused adventures of the characters as they evade the Germans and seek rest and companionship. \"Bon Voyage\" takes on the challenge of the dire topic of war and situates a charming group of characters across France's occupation as a backdrop, and the intertwined relationships and various coincidences with the characters make the film very entertaining. As some decide to stay in France and make good of the German occupation, others go underground or decide to escape to London.

After lying to her friends, claiming she has a phone and is going to the dentist's, April chooses to play truant. While at work at a stately home, Marion hears that April has not arrived at school. She talks to her friend and colleague Elliot, who unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her from leaving. April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting telling the story of her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. In a flashback, a young April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship is an abusive one, leading to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realises that they were lied to. April then leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and, in a shopping centre, meets Elliot, who has joined her. April then visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year old April lives at the Sunnyholme. Cared for by a woman named Mo, April befriends an older girl called Gina and is introduced to Pearl, a girl of her age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April. Gina wakes April one night to involve her in a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water, and then tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, who she pushes down a flight of stairs, and is reprimanded by Mo. A voice-over from 14-year-old April says Gina was then \"moved on\", and, eventually, April is also moved on. The flashback jumps forward to April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean . A piece of work on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from going out on a Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number on the side of a dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her real mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.\n",

            "Aurore Gagnon, born in 1909 to Marie-Anne Caron and Telesphore Gagnon, is the second child of the couple. During the first nine years of her life, Aurore enjoys a happy life. Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney. When the peace judge and several others, including doctors, arrive at Aurore's home, it is too late: she collapsed on the stairs and was attacked again by Marie-Anne with a 2X4. Doctors are unable to save Aurore, who passes away from blood poisoning. After Aurore's funeral, the couple is arrested for Aurore's death. Telesphore is sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter. His cousin and wife Marie-Anne is initially sentenced to death by hanging for second degree murder. She is then given a life sentence, but health issues force her to leave the jail, and she later dies from breast and brain cancer. Father Leduc, whom Oreus blames for his lack of action on the case, kills himself with explosives.\n",

            "The film opens with a young girl  running through a graveyard, crying, her face covered with skull paint. She makes it to her house and her parents ask her what's wrong. The little girl, named Sandy, responds by stating, \"I don't remember.\" Years later, Sandy Channing  and her brother, Eli , are both academic students with scholarships to Stanford University. They go to a party at night at their friend T.J.'s house, and they and their friends go to the graveyard to play a game. As they are about to start, a girl about their age  asks to play. They allow her, and they play a different version of tag, where one of them is a ghost, and whoever the ghost tags becomes a ghost until there is one left. Eli, who is the ghost, and the others tag everyone, leaving the unnamed girl the winner. As Sandy tells her that she's won, the girl asks if she remembers her. Sandy tells her she doesn't, with the girl stating, \"You will,\" before jumping from the cliff behind her. The police arrive but are unable to find a body. The group then decides to call it a night and go home. The next day, Layla  and Chad  are on the side of the road after having sex in Chad's car, with Chad telling Layla he wants to break up. Furious, Layla throws his class ring, which was hanging on her necklace, into the lake. With Chad driving off and leaving her alone at the lake, Layla goes into the water to retrieve the necklace when she sees a girl seemingly drown. When Layla swims to the buoy to look for the girl, it's as if the girl was never there and she swims back toward the shore. However, before she can get out of the water, she sees the girl floating lifelessly in front of her. Leaning down to see if the girl is okay, Layla is pulled into the water and drowned by the girl, who is revealed to be a demon-like incarnation of the unnamed girl who had disappeared the night before. Meanwhile, Chad arrives at Sandy and Eli's house with a different girl in tow, candy striper Cecilia . Looking on in disgust, Sandy asks what would Layla think, with Chad replying, \"Who?\" Before anything else happens, Chad leaves to take Cecilia back to the hospital. As the rest of the group is waiting for T.J.  to get off of work, T.J. is negotiating a deal to buy an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Lex . After bartering his paycheck for the ring, T.J. is asked to check the safety on machines one, two, and three before going home. As he is alone, he opts to smoke a little pot before doing so. After checking the safety on the first two machines, T.J. believes he sees someone at the other end of the warehouse before deducting it was an hallucination, stating, \"Note to self: drugs are bad.\" However, he is soon scared by the sight of the demonic Layla and gets his caught in the machine , before having his head pushed into the machine by the unnamed demonic girl. Just after this, Jake  remembers he forgot to get beer for their trip, to which Sandy replies that T.J. was supposed to be bringing it. However, just like Layla, the rest of the group has no memory of T.J. and Sandy decides to call him, only to find his contact information erased from her cellphone. Just then, Jake and Lex's dad, Sheriff Mitchell , pulls up in his patrol car to drop off Lex. Opting to go on with their spring break trip to the beach, the group stops at a convenience, with Lex distracting the cashier by having sex with him in the backroom while the rest of the friends steal liquor and food. Frustrated with Lex's seemingly promiscuous behavior despite dating T.J., Sandy walks off while Eli and Hannah  look on. Going after Sandy, Jake asks who T.J. is and calls Chad to check to make sure he is on his way. After hanging up, however, Chad is killed when the ghosts scare him into flipping his car, with the unnamed girl making it explode. Leaving the store, the group gets into Eli's Jeep with Sandy asking Jake where his bike went, to which responds that he had left it at her house. Once on the road, Sandy becomes even more confused when her stuff and the beach gear are gone, but her friends look at her confusingly, asking why they would be taking a boogie board to the mountains for spring break. Just then, Sandy yells at Eli to pull the car over, with Sandy getting out to look at Chad's car, battered and dirty in a junkyard. However, for some strange reason, no one but Sandy remembers who Chad is, and they soon drive to T.J.'s house, which appears vacant and in ruin, the apparent scene of some unknown crime of some sort, as there is caution tape around the house and yard. As Sandy goes into the house with her boyfriend Jake and her brother Eli, the other girls, Lex and Hannah, get into an argument in the car. At the same time, Sandy begins to remember the unnamed girl from the graveyard as her friend when she was little, but nothing more. Later, Lex is killed by what appears to be undead versions of her murdered friends, with Sandy witnessing her demise. The other three think Sandy is losing her mind, as none of the others remember Lex anymore. Sandy and the others go to the police station, where they learn the mysterious girl's name is Angela Smith and she lives in a convent. Sandy begs her friends to go with her, and they agree, but also agree to wait until morning. At a local hotel, Sandy sleeps due to a sleeping pill in her drink while Hannah and Eli go to the pool and have sex. Eli goes back up to the room to find Jake trying to contain Sandy who is throwing herself around in the room. Hannah is killed, and Sandy and Jake are now alone in the hotel room. Eli calls Sandy and tells her he can no longer cover for her. She then tells him to meet her at the convent. She and Jake then discover Angela is in a coma. At the convent, Jake is killed. Eli, who doesn't remember Jake, picks up a shaken Sandy. Sandy cries over her dead boyfriend, and Eli begins to realize that they are being erased in time, just like the rhyme they sang before playing the game in the graveyard. After heading home, Sandy, whose parents believe she has become depressed and suicidal, is sedated and taken to the hospital. While there, Eli is attacked and killed by the undead versions of his murdered friends. As Sandy is sedated again once at the hospital, she asks for Eli, of whom her parents have no recollection at all. Asking if Eli is a friend of hers, Sandy's parents tells the doctor that she has no friends. Later, Sandy dreams of a time where she and her friends played a scary prank on Angela , who had a seizure in front of the convent after knocking her head into the door. It is soon revealed that the little girl at the beginning of the film is a young Sandy, and the girl who mysteriously vanished and who has been committing the murders is, in fact, Angela. Sandy awakes and, recalling the rhyme to \"kill the ghost or seal your fate,\" goes to Angela's room and switches off her life support. Leaving the room, she hears beats from Angela's cardiac monitor and returns to the room, only to find Angela sitting up in her bed. Sandy is then chased up to the roof by the ghosts of her friends, and encounters the young version of Angela. Despite a failed attempt to reason with her, Sandy falls from the roof of the hospital. The film ends with Angela \"miraculously\" awaking from her coma, while Sandy is revealed to have taken her place in a coma of her own. The mystery about Eli & the friends is not revealed whether they were imaginary people or real.\n",

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

During a tense conversation with Rosetta, Melora learns that her daughter Krista had been a prostitute, that she bore a daughter, and that Melora's late husband had sexually abused her own daughter Krista.

            "It is 1940. When the movie begins, film star Viviane Denvert sits in the audience of a premiere of her new movie and notices a man who keeps staring at her. She is disturbed, and when the film is over and the audience has finished praising her, she rushes home, discovering that she is pursued by that same man. He chases her into her apartment. An hour later, Frédéric Auger, a young writer, receives a call from Viviane, who was his childhood crush. Viviane, who has long used Frédéric's devotion, asks him to come to her apartment immediately. Upon arriving, he discovers a corpse, \"accidentally\" killed, which Viviane asks him to dispose of, claiming that the man had been harassing her and when she slapped him, he had fallen over the edge of the balcony. He agrees to help her and the two pack the corpse into the trunk of his car; however, as it is raining, he accidentally drives into a curb and hits a police signalling device . The trunk opens upon impact, revealing the dead body to the arriving police and so, Frederic is arrested and sent to prison. On the eve of the German occupation of Paris, all of the city's citizens evacuate, including the prisoners. Prisoners are paired up with another and hand cuffed together. Frédéric and his cellmate Raoul take advantage of the confusion to escape. Frédéric then takes the train to Bordeaux, where he learns that Viviane is. It so happens that Raoul is also on the train and he leads Frederic to a seat near another girl, Camille. Camille turns out to be a student of a physics professor; the two of them are guarding French stocks of heavy water that they must ship to England before the Germans can get their hands on it and create an atomic bomb. The remainder of the film traces the confused adventures of the characters as they evade the Germans and seek rest and companionship. \"Bon Voyage\" takes on the challenge of the dire topic of war and situates a charming group of characters across France's occupation as a backdrop, and the intertwined relationships and various coincidences with the characters make the film very entertaining. As some decide to stay in France and make good of the German occupation, others go underground or decide to escape to London. In a very short scene, a quite recognizable General Charles de Gaulle is told \"Bon voyage\" by one of his aides. As Frédéric becomes involved in the French Résistance, he eventually falls for Camille. At the end of the film, Frederic returns from England to meet with Camille at an outdoor cafe. When Germans recognize them, the couple flees and sneak into a movie theatre. When Frederic sees one of their pursuers enter the theater and search for their faces, he turns and kisses Camille. They stop once their pursuer leaves. Frederic looks up at the screen and is surprised to see Viviane singing and dancing, signifying that she has once again risen as a movie star. However, Frederic turns to Camille, and they resume kissing as the film comes to a close.\n",

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love.

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments.

In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments.

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

Now they are all women - mostly wives and mothers. Wiktor discovers that Fela, once the closest to him, is now dead for some time and other sisters aren't too keen to talk about her and her grave is rather forgotten. He is also disappointed with how all the women have changed. Julia , now a mother of two, doesn't resemble his first object of love and desire she once was and doesn't show him an affection he might expected. Jola , seemingly unhappy in her marriage, chases him and makes fun of it, until he doesn't bring the painful memories of the past. Kazia , a divorcee - thus treated like less worthy than others - is the most demanding partner of his intellectual reflections while Zosia  is - as always - distant and outspoken. That leaves him with Tunia  who was only a child when he previously knew her but now resembles Fela. Wiktor spends time in Wilko but isn't able to see that his return restored once forgotten dreams and hopes of the sisters...\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

            "The plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

Olivia excuses herself to go to the ladies room and is attacked by Tommy’s associate, Freddie \"Flakes\" , who in an attempt to prevent her testimony bashes her head on a mirror, causing permanent disfigurement to her face. Freddie escapes, although Paul gets a look at him. At the hospital, where Paul is told Olivia will need reconstructive surgery, he talks with Lt. Mickey King , who has been working on the O’Shea case for 16 years. Paul is angry but is warned by King not to pick up his old habits and to let the police handle it. Tommy escalates the violence, killing several people including female police officer Janice Omori . Paul and Olivia are attacked by Freddie, who ends up shooting Olivia in the back  as the couple tries to escape. She becomes the fourth of Paul's five love interests in the series to be murdered by gang members. Tommy is \"cleared\" of involvement in his ex-wife’s death and seeks custody of their daughter. This sets the stage for a fight between Paul and Tommy, one that leaves Paul unconscious. He decides to return to his vigilante ways and is later assisted by Hoyle, who learns his department has been corrupted by Tommy. Tommy hires three thugs, Frankie , Mickey , and Angel , to take care of Paul, using Chelsea as bait. Paul rescues her. Lt. King is wounded by Tommy. Tommy tries to persuade Paul to spare him by saying \"Anything you want, anything you need, it's yours.\" Paul quickly responds with \"I don't need anything, but you could use a bath.\" Paul then finally manages to kill Tommy by knocking him into the pool of acid. He rejoins Chelsea, calling out to the injured King, \"Hey Lieutenant, if you need any help, give me a call\" while Paul walks toward the 'lightened' hallway.\n",

            "In Tokyo, during an evening get-together with friends, Okazaki Yoko's  cell phone suddenly rings in an eerie, unusual tone, cartoon styled. Not recognizing the tone, Yoko doesn't pick up soon enough and the call goes into \"voice mail\" . When she sees that the call/message was from her own phone number and dated two days into the future, both she and her friend Nakamura Yumi  listen intently to the message. What they hear is the voice of Yoko in casual chit-chat, followed by a horrendous scream and then dead silence, which visibly disturbs Yoko and Yumi. The two girls attempt to laugh the message off and even share the story with their friends, who are just as clueless as them. She tells her friends that she received the call to her cell phone on Apr 16 at 11:04 p.m. Her cell phone indicated that the message was from Apr 18 at 11:04 p.m. At exactly 11:04 p.m. on April 18, Yumi receives a call from Yoko. During that call, Yoko goes through the very same chit-chat as was on her previous voice mail. As Yumi suddenly realizes what might happen next, she hears Yoko shriek into the phone. Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko's severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji's  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi's house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi's feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi's phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi's apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi's reflection in nearby mirror, it's Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she'll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to \"take care of\" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.\n",

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral.

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Just outside town, a young couple Eric  and Ashley  are traveling to meet with Charlie as part of their university course. Eric notices a strange weather pattern however Ashley takes no notice, as she is in a rush to get to the book signing. In town, Nora is taken to hospital for injuries while Charlie meets up with his old friend Joanne and also Damon, who have rushed to the scene after their computers detected the storm. Joanne wishes to stop the program and so orders Damon to phone their backer Frank . However Frank tells Damon he will not stop the experiment until it has been completed and so allows the small UAVs to continue flying. Meanwhile, another storm freezes a farmer. Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the scene where they discover one of the UAVs that has crashed. Joanne tells Charlie about the experiment. Nora then phones Charlie. She is leaving town for the TV show Charlie has an appearance on later that day. Meanwhile, Eric and Ashley arrive at the book signing to discover it has finished and begin to leave town. Charlie, Joanne and Damon travel back to their experiment site, where they meet up with Gary and Phil. Charlie comes up with a theory of how the UAVs are causing the storms, and Damon tells Joanne Frank has not aborted the experiment. Angrily, Joanne phones Frank to warn him, but Frank rejects her calls. As Eric and Ashley leave town, a tornado forms. Nora's car is hit by debris. After the tornado disappears, Eric and Ashley walk back to town. At the experiment site, another tornado hits. The group flee but Phil is killed. They go to a nearby hotel where they discover Frank has blocked them from deactivating the UAVs. Eric and Ashley break into a building where they decide to change their presentation to the freak weather after Eric caught it on camera. The group come across wreckage where they discover Nora's body. A furious Joanne blames Damon for not making Frank finish the experiment. As Charlie mourns Nora's death, another storm hits, forcing the group to flee.

The group travel to the same building Eric and Ashley are at, and Gary begins to try and deactivate the UAVs. They realize the storms will reach populated areas very soon and warn Frank, who allows the UAVs to be destroyed. However, the storm continues to grow despite the UAVs having been destroyed. While Eric and Ashley send out signals to warn people, Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the university to use its satellite to punch a hole in the ozone layer to extinguish the storms. While arriving, Damon is killed by large hailstones. Meanwhile Gary manages to connect to a satellite in space. The plan works and the storms are extinguished.

            "The film is a contemporary  picture that takes place in New York City. The story involves a mad scientist who turns circumstances on a young man to do his bidding. Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments.

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

            "The plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

Melora, Krista's mother, is notified. Melora goes to Krista's previous house and finds Rosetta, Krista's former roommate. During a tense conversation with Rosetta, Melora learns that her daughter Krista had been a prostitute, that she bore a daughter, and that Melora's late husband had sexually abused her own daughter Krista.

            "War veteran turned small-town policeman Ma Shan  wakes up after a drunken night at his sister's wedding banquet to find his issued gun missing. After making sure his wife Han Xiaoyun  and third-grader son have not taken it, Ma embarks on a search around the town. He questions his sister and brother-in-law, as well as two ex-comrades in an attempt to connect the dots. He finds out that he was sent home the previous night in a car by Zhou Xiaogang . Ma knocks on Zhou's door but is greeted by Li Xiaomeng , Ma's former lover who married and moved to Guangzhou, but has since returned. Li claims that Zhou is not home. Ma leaves but manages to run into Zhou a moment later. After searching Zhou's car, he ascertains that Zhou has not taken his gun either. Ma is left with no choice but to report the missing gun to his superiors. He is stripped of his uniform but is allowed to continue the search on his own. During his search, Ma comes across a thief who has snatched a woman's handbag and gives chase. The desperate thief, seeing no escape, pulls out a gun. Mistaking the gun for his own, Ma refuses to back down. The thief fires, only to reveal that the gun he holds is a fake. Meanwhile, a murder has taken place in town. A man has sneaked into Zhou's home and shoots Li with the missing gun. Upon interrogation, Zhou insists that he was not the intended target. However, a private investigation undertaken by Ma reveals that Zhou owns an underground factory producing counterfeit wine. Ma then retains Zhou, exchanges clothing with him, and boards a bus heading out of town. True to his prediction, the criminal trails him, thinking that he was Zhou, shoots him from behind at the railway station but fails to kill him instantly. As the criminal approaches to confirm his kill, Ma turns over and locks the two of them together with his handcuffs. The criminal turns out to be Stammer Liu, a local bricklayer whose family was poisoned after drinking Zhou's wine. Liu begs Ma to let him go to avenge his family but Ma refuses. Ma then draws out the fake gun he confiscated from the thief earlier and Liu, in fear, pulls the trigger and spends the last bullet left on the former. Ma bleeds profusely and feels faint, lying on the ground. As policemen discover the crime and rush over to apprehend Liu, Ma is shown to suddenly stand upright and walk away with his recovered gun, apparently unhurt from the wounds and euphoric at finding his lost weapon. It is left ambiguous if this is the hallucination of a dying Ma.\n",

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko's severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji's  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi's house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi's feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi's phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi's apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi's reflection in nearby mirror, it's Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she'll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to \"take care of\" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.\n",

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney.

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments.

Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's.

            "The film begins by depicting the fabled tale of how the gypsies came to be. According to folklore gypsies are descendants of an Egyptian pharaoh. In the film, actors are dressed in ancient Egyptian costumes as they dance to flamenco music. As the story continues, the gypsies are run out of their lands and are forced to live nomadic lives, stealing and thieving as a means to survive. The Monty Pythonesque history lesson then continues to present the protagonists’ ancestors and the scene that drives the rest of the film: Trinidad’s  ancestor places a spell on Enrique’s  ancestor that will cause his descendant to fall in madly in love with her descendant. The story continues to the present day, that is to say the 1950s, where Trinidad and her uncle Regalito  are charged with stealing six hams from a shop window. This scene presents some of the most entertaining banter in the entire film as Trinidad and Regalito argue their innocence with very matter-of-fact language and mannerisms common to Andalusian gypsies. Their witty mockery, while creating uproars of laughter from the courtroom audience, causes the judges to grow more infuriated with the pair. It is then that Enrique, a lawyer, steps in to defend Trinidad and Regalito. After much deliberation, the two gypsies, after having to pay a fee, are set free. The fee they are required to pay forces Trinidad to find employment. Coincidentally, she finds a job as a maid in Seville at the home of Enrique, the lawyer. Instead of dismissing Trinidad, Enrique decides to make her part of an experiment he plans to conduct. His experiment is to see if he can turn Trinidad from a thieving gypsy into a functioning member of Spanish society. He plans to track change in his Pygmalion-like experiment by playing a song and seeing how she reacts to it. The more refined she becomes, the less she should react to the folkloric music. Trinidad’s reaction to Enrique’s statement, while humorous, presents the moral of the story: she tells him that the spirit of a gypsy is something that no one can tame and that, even though she will try because he has asked her to do this for him, it is an impossible task. Fitted with new, modern clothing, Trinidad’s reaction to the music is a romping performance full of beautiful arm movements and earth-shaking stomps.<ref nameHU3e9MRSexo YouTube-Morena Clara] Trinidad’s performance is so spell binding that, not only is Enrique entranced, but her impromptu tune is so catchy that he hums along to it the very next morning. As the months go by, Enrique’s experiment grows more futile as Trinidad’s charisma wins him over. As Enrique’s coworker sees how entranced he has become by her, he plots to convince Trinidad to leave with the pretense that Enrique’s career might be jeopardized by her presence in his household. Trinidad instantly decides to leave as the last thing she wants to do is hurt Enrique. She makes the decision to say goodbye to him by performing a song dedicated to him. In an emotionally driven performance, Trinidad performs a powerful rendition of “Te Lo Juro Yo,”<ref name6oLZ62z4RHo&feature=related YouTube-Te Lo Juro Yo], quickly leaving as soon as the song is done. In the end, Enrique tracks down Trinidad and declares his love for her.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

In the morning, Arden calls the police to report a woman  left alone at home. *The Sister: Leah is prepping the dead woman in the morgue when she notices a certain birthmark.

The sheriff delivers the test result: the dead woman is NOT Jenny. *The Wife: Ruth is angry that her husband, Carl, constantly leaves her alone night after night. The next morning, she discovers clothing, wallets, and ID's in ziplock bags inside a storage unit that is supposedly empty. She matches the IDs to names in the newspapers of the serial killer's victims. Carl comes back late at night with scratches on his neck. After another argument, he leaves the house to go to the car outside. He pulls a trash bag out of the trunk and goes to the storage unit. Ruth asks Carl if he knows anything about the dead women, and he says no. Later that night, Ruth enters the unit and pulls everything out.

Melora, Krista's mother, is notified. Melora goes to Krista's previous house and finds Rosetta, Krista's former roommate. During a tense conversation with Rosetta, Melora learns that her daughter Krista had been a prostitute, that she bore a daughter, and that Melora's late husband had sexually abused her own daughter Krista.

She is disturbed, and when the film is over and the audience has finished praising her, she rushes home, discovering that she is pursued by that same man. He chases her into her apartment. An hour later, Frédéric Auger, a young writer, receives a call from Viviane, who was his childhood crush. Viviane, who has long used Frédéric's devotion, asks him to come to her apartment immediately. Upon arriving, he discovers a corpse, \"accidentally\" killed, which Viviane asks him to dispose of, claiming that the man had been harassing her and when she slapped him, he had fallen over the edge of the balcony. He agrees to help her and the two pack the corpse into the trunk of his car; however, as it is raining, he accidentally drives into a curb and hits a police signalling device . The trunk opens upon impact, revealing the dead body to the arriving police and so, Frederic is arrested and sent to prison. On the eve of the German occupation of Paris, all of the city's citizens evacuate, including the prisoners. Prisoners are paired up with another and hand cuffed together. Frédéric and his cellmate Raoul take advantage of the confusion to escape. Frédéric then takes the train to Bordeaux, where he learns that Viviane is. It so happens that Raoul is also on the train and he leads Frederic to a seat near another girl, Camille. Camille turns out to be a student of a physics professor; the two of them are guarding French stocks of heavy water that they must ship to England before the Germans can get their hands on it and create an atomic bomb. The remainder of the film traces the confused adventures of the characters as they evade the Germans and seek rest and companionship. \"Bon Voyage\" takes on the challenge of the dire topic of war and situates a charming group of characters across France's occupation as a backdrop, and the intertwined relationships and various coincidences with the characters make the film very entertaining. As some decide to stay in France and make good of the German occupation, others go underground or decide to escape to London. In a very short scene, a quite recognizable General Charles de Gaulle is told \"Bon voyage\" by one of his aides. As Frédéric becomes involved in the French Résistance, he eventually falls for Camille. At the end of the film, Frederic returns from England to meet with Camille at an outdoor cafe. When Germans recognize them, the couple flees and sneak into a movie theatre. When Frederic sees one of their pursuers enter the theater and search for their faces, he turns and kisses Camille. They stop once their pursuer leaves. Frederic looks up at the screen and is surprised to see Viviane singing and dancing, signifying that she has once again risen as a movie star. However, Frederic turns to Camille, and they resume kissing as the film comes to a close.\n",

But in reality, he hates Leo and wants to get rid of him. Further complicating Leo's life is Julius  who has asked Leo to kill his wife, Gloria. Only when it comes time to be paid, Julius, who has Leo committing the murder on tape, confesses he doesn't have a wife; he paid a woman to pretend to be his wife. Julius wants 500,000 in pounds, otherwise he will release the tape to the authorities. Then Moose shows up and He is looking for a woman who is the love of his life. Her name is Gloria. He asks if Leo could help him find her and Leo reluctantly agrees. Finally there's Troy, a loan shark. Leo owes him a lot of money, but he's lost it all at the track. Troy is getting increasingly impatient and violent as he doesn't like to be kept waiting on his money. Evidence is piling up that Lily is working a con on Leo. With all of these problems, it doesn't look as if Leo will survive the week. Bruno's in trouble with the Inland Revenue, so his accountant, Julius, comes up with an idea to con Lily by turning all of Bruno's shipping company over to her, while Bruno pockets a cool $20 million. Only the problem is that Leo has got to Julius first and worked out a con of his own. Together Julius and Leo staged Gloria's murder. Leo goes to meet Julius with the blackmail money. Bruno has men with guns waiting, but Moose shows up to even out the fight. A bloodbath ensues and Julius, the only survivor, tells the tale to Bruno. Only Leo is not dead, and he leaves a recording that Lily finds and then shows to Bruno. Leo figured out that Lily was conning him and he confesses that he stole Bruno's money. An enraged Lily and Bruno go to find Julius and catch him as he is splitting town. But then Leo shows up wanting to kill Bruno. Bruno says that Leo can't possibly kill him because he'd have to kill his wife also. Reluctantly Leo agrees... and shots Lily. Then he convinces Julius that the only way they can be partners is if he kills Bruno, so that they have a murder each on their hands. Julius doesn't mean to, but the gun goes off and Bruno is dead. During their getaway, Julius begins to feel odd. Leo confesses that he slipped a sedative into Julius' drink. He leaves a drugged Julius by the side of the road as he makes his way to the train station. There he meets up with someone—Lily.\n",

After lying to her friends, claiming she has a phone and is going to the dentist's, April chooses to play truant. While at work at a stately home, Marion hears that April has not arrived at school. She talks to her friend and colleague Elliot, who unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her from leaving. April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting telling the story of her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. In a flashback, a young April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship is an abusive one, leading to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realises that they were lied to. April then leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and, in a shopping centre, meets Elliot, who has joined her. April then visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year old April lives at the Sunnyholme. Cared for by a woman named Mo, April befriends an older girl called Gina and is introduced to Pearl, a girl of her age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April. Gina wakes April one night to involve her in a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water, and then tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, who she pushes down a flight of stairs, and is reprimanded by Mo. A voice-over from 14-year-old April says Gina was then \"moved on\", and, eventually, April is also moved on. The flashback jumps forward to April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean . A piece of work on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from going out on a Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number on the side of a dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her real mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.\n",

            "Aurore Gagnon, born in 1909 to Marie-Anne Caron and Telesphore Gagnon, is the second child of the couple. During the first nine years of her life, Aurore enjoys a happy life. Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney. When the peace judge and several others, including doctors, arrive at Aurore's home, it is too late: she collapsed on the stairs and was attacked again by Marie-Anne with a 2X4. Doctors are unable to save Aurore, who passes away from blood poisoning. After Aurore's funeral, the couple is arrested for Aurore's death. Telesphore is sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter. His cousin and wife Marie-Anne is initially sentenced to death by hanging for second degree murder. She is then given a life sentence, but health issues force her to leave the jail, and she later dies from breast and brain cancer. Father Leduc, whom Oreus blames for his lack of action on the case, kills himself with explosives.\n",

            "The film opens with a young girl  running through a graveyard, crying, her face covered with skull paint. She makes it to her house and her parents ask her what's wrong. The little girl, named Sandy, responds by stating, \"I don't remember.\" Years later, Sandy Channing  and her brother, Eli , are both academic students with scholarships to Stanford University. They go to a party at night at their friend T.J.'s house, and they and their friends go to the graveyard to play a game. As they are about to start, a girl about their age  asks to play. They allow her, and they play a different version of tag, where one of them is a ghost, and whoever the ghost tags becomes a ghost until there is one left. Eli, who is the ghost, and the others tag everyone, leaving the unnamed girl the winner. As Sandy tells her that she's won, the girl asks if she remembers her. Sandy tells her she doesn't, with the girl stating, \"You will,\" before jumping from the cliff behind her. The police arrive but are unable to find a body. The group then decides to call it a night and go home. The next day, Layla  and Chad  are on the side of the road after having sex in Chad's car, with Chad telling Layla he wants to break up. Furious, Layla throws his class ring, which was hanging on her necklace, into the lake. With Chad driving off and leaving her alone at the lake, Layla goes into the water to retrieve the necklace when she sees a girl seemingly drown. When Layla swims to the buoy to look for the girl, it's as if the girl was never there and she swims back toward the shore. However, before she can get out of the water, she sees the girl floating lifelessly in front of her. Leaning down to see if the girl is okay, Layla is pulled into the water and drowned by the girl, who is revealed to be a demon-like incarnation of the unnamed girl who had disappeared the night before. Meanwhile, Chad arrives at Sandy and Eli's house with a different girl in tow, candy striper Cecilia . Looking on in disgust, Sandy asks what would Layla think, with Chad replying, \"Who?\" Before anything else happens, Chad leaves to take Cecilia back to the hospital. As the rest of the group is waiting for T.J.  to get off of work, T.J. is negotiating a deal to buy an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Lex . After bartering his paycheck for the ring, T.J. is asked to check the safety on machines one, two, and three before going home. As he is alone, he opts to smoke a little pot before doing so. After checking the safety on the first two machines, T.J. believes he sees someone at the other end of the warehouse before deducting it was an hallucination, stating, \"Note to self: drugs are bad.\" However, he is soon scared by the sight of the demonic Layla and gets his caught in the machine , before having his head pushed into the machine by the unnamed demonic girl. Just after this, Jake  remembers he forgot to get beer for their trip, to which Sandy replies that T.J. was supposed to be bringing it. However, just like Layla, the rest of the group has no memory of T.J. and Sandy decides to call him, only to find his contact information erased from her cellphone. Just then, Jake and Lex's dad, Sheriff Mitchell , pulls up in his patrol car to drop off Lex. Opting to go on with their spring break trip to the beach, the group stops at a convenience, with Lex distracting the cashier by having sex with him in the backroom while the rest of the friends steal liquor and food. Frustrated with Lex's seemingly promiscuous behavior despite dating T.J., Sandy walks off while Eli and Hannah  look on. Going after Sandy, Jake asks who T.J. is and calls Chad to check to make sure he is on his way. After hanging up, however, Chad is killed when the ghosts scare him into flipping his car, with the unnamed girl making it explode. Leaving the store, the group gets into Eli's Jeep with Sandy asking Jake where his bike went, to which responds that he had left it at her house. Once on the road, Sandy becomes even more confused when her stuff and the beach gear are gone, but her friends look at her confusingly, asking why they would be taking a boogie board to the mountains for spring break. Just then, Sandy yells at Eli to pull the car over, with Sandy getting out to look at Chad's car, battered and dirty in a junkyard. However, for some strange reason, no one but Sandy remembers who Chad is, and they soon drive to T.J.'s house, which appears vacant and in ruin, the apparent scene of some unknown crime of some sort, as there is caution tape around the house and yard. As Sandy goes into the house with her boyfriend Jake and her brother Eli, the other girls, Lex and Hannah, get into an argument in the car. At the same time, Sandy begins to remember the unnamed girl from the graveyard as her friend when she was little, but nothing more. Later, Lex is killed by what appears to be undead versions of her murdered friends, with Sandy witnessing her demise. The other three think Sandy is losing her mind, as none of the others remember Lex anymore. Sandy and the others go to the police station, where they learn the mysterious girl's name is Angela Smith and she lives in a convent. Sandy begs her friends to go with her, and they agree, but also agree to wait until morning. At a local hotel, Sandy sleeps due to a sleeping pill in her drink while Hannah and Eli go to the pool and have sex. Eli goes back up to the room to find Jake trying to contain Sandy who is throwing herself around in the room. Hannah is killed, and Sandy and Jake are now alone in the hotel room. Eli calls Sandy and tells her he can no longer cover for her. She then tells him to meet her at the convent. She and Jake then discover Angela is in a coma. At the convent, Jake is killed. Eli, who doesn't remember Jake, picks up a shaken Sandy. Sandy cries over her dead boyfriend, and Eli begins to realize that they are being erased in time, just like the rhyme they sang before playing the game in the graveyard. After heading home, Sandy, whose parents believe she has become depressed and suicidal, is sedated and taken to the hospital. While there, Eli is attacked and killed by the undead versions of his murdered friends. As Sandy is sedated again once at the hospital, she asks for Eli, of whom her parents have no recollection at all. Asking if Eli is a friend of hers, Sandy's parents tells the doctor that she has no friends. Later, Sandy dreams of a time where she and her friends played a scary prank on Angela , who had a seizure in front of the convent after knocking her head into the door. It is soon revealed that the little girl at the beginning of the film is a young Sandy, and the girl who mysteriously vanished and who has been committing the murders is, in fact, Angela. Sandy awakes and, recalling the rhyme to \"kill the ghost or seal your fate,\" goes to Angela's room and switches off her life support. Leaving the room, she hears beats from Angela's cardiac monitor and returns to the room, only to find Angela sitting up in her bed. Sandy is then chased up to the roof by the ghosts of her friends, and encounters the young version of Angela. Despite a failed attempt to reason with her, Sandy falls from the roof of the hospital. The film ends with Angela \"miraculously\" awaking from her coma, while Sandy is revealed to have taken her place in a coma of her own. The mystery about Eli & the friends is not revealed whether they were imaginary people or real.\n",

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

            "The plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

            "It is 1940. When the movie begins, film star Viviane Denvert sits in the audience of a premiere of her new movie and notices a man who keeps staring at her. She is disturbed, and when the film is over and the audience has finished praising her, she rushes home, discovering that she is pursued by that same man. He chases her into her apartment. An hour later, Frédéric Auger, a young writer, receives a call from Viviane, who was his childhood crush. Viviane, who has long used Frédéric's devotion, asks him to come to her apartment immediately. Upon arriving, he discovers a corpse, \"accidentally\" killed, which Viviane asks him to dispose of, claiming that the man had been harassing her and when she slapped him, he had fallen over the edge of the balcony. He agrees to help her and the two pack the corpse into the trunk of his car; however, as it is raining, he accidentally drives into a curb and hits a police signalling device . The trunk opens upon impact, revealing the dead body to the arriving police and so, Frederic is arrested and sent to prison. On the eve of the German occupation of Paris, all of the city's citizens evacuate, including the prisoners. Prisoners are paired up with another and hand cuffed together. Frédéric and his cellmate Raoul take advantage of the confusion to escape. Frédéric then takes the train to Bordeaux, where he learns that Viviane is. It so happens that Raoul is also on the train and he leads Frederic to a seat near another girl, Camille. Camille turns out to be a student of a physics professor; the two of them are guarding French stocks of heavy water that they must ship to England before the Germans can get their hands on it and create an atomic bomb. The remainder of the film traces the confused adventures of the characters as they evade the Germans and seek rest and companionship. \"Bon Voyage\" takes on the challenge of the dire topic of war and situates a charming group of characters across France's occupation as a backdrop, and the intertwined relationships and various coincidences with the characters make the film very entertaining. As some decide to stay in France and make good of the German occupation, others go underground or decide to escape to London. In a very short scene, a quite recognizable General Charles de Gaulle is told \"Bon voyage\" by one of his aides. As Frédéric becomes involved in the French Résistance, he eventually falls for Camille. At the end of the film, Frederic returns from England to meet with Camille at an outdoor cafe. When Germans recognize them, the couple flees and sneak into a movie theatre. When Frederic sees one of their pursuers enter the theater and search for their faces, he turns and kisses Camille. They stop once their pursuer leaves. Frederic looks up at the screen and is surprised to see Viviane singing and dancing, signifying that she has once again risen as a movie star. However, Frederic turns to Camille, and they resume kissing as the film comes to a close.\n",

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney. When the peace judge and several others, including doctors, arrive at Aurore's home, it is too late: she collapsed on the stairs and was attacked again by Marie-Anne with a 2X4. Doctors are unable to save Aurore, who passes away from blood poisoning. After Aurore's funeral, the couple is arrested for Aurore's death. Telesphore is sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter.

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Eric notices a strange weather pattern however Ashley takes no notice, as she is in a rush to get to the book signing. In town, Nora is taken to hospital for injuries while Charlie meets up with his old friend Joanne and also Damon, who have rushed to the scene after their computers detected the storm. Joanne wishes to stop the program and so orders Damon to phone their backer Frank . However Frank tells Damon he will not stop the experiment until it has been completed and so allows the small UAVs to continue flying. Meanwhile, another storm freezes a farmer. Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the scene where they discover one of the UAVs that has crashed. Joanne tells Charlie about the experiment. Nora then phones Charlie. She is leaving town for the TV show Charlie has an appearance on later that day. Meanwhile, Eric and Ashley arrive at the book signing to discover it has finished and begin to leave town. Charlie, Joanne and Damon travel back to their experiment site, where they meet up with Gary and Phil.

Angrily, Joanne phones Frank to warn him, but Frank rejects her calls. As Eric and Ashley leave town, a tornado forms. Nora's car is hit by debris. After the tornado disappears, Eric and Ashley walk back to town. At the experiment site, another tornado hits. The group flee but Phil is killed.

Eric and Ashley break into a building where they decide to change their presentation to the freak weather after Eric caught it on camera. The group come across wreckage where they discover Nora's body. A furious Joanne blames Damon for not making Frank finish the experiment.

The group travel to the same building Eric and Ashley are at, and Gary begins to try and deactivate the UAVs. They realize the storms will reach populated areas very soon and warn Frank, who allows the UAVs to be destroyed. However, the storm continues to grow despite the UAVs having been destroyed. While Eric and Ashley send out signals to warn people, Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the university to use its satellite to punch a hole in the ozone layer to extinguish the storms. While arriving, Damon is killed by large hailstones. Meanwhile Gary manages to connect to a satellite in space. The plan works and the storms are extinguished.

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

            "The plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

            "In Tokyo, during an evening get-together with friends, Okazaki Yoko's  cell phone suddenly rings in an eerie, unusual tone, cartoon styled. Not recognizing the tone, Yoko doesn't pick up soon enough and the call goes into \"voice mail\" . When she sees that the call/message was from her own phone number and dated two days into the future, both she and her friend Nakamura Yumi  listen intently to the message. What they hear is the voice of Yoko in casual chit-chat, followed by a horrendous scream and then dead silence, which visibly disturbs Yoko and Yumi. The two girls attempt to laugh the message off and even share the story with their friends, who are just as clueless as them. She tells her friends that she received the call to her cell phone on Apr 16 at 11:04 p.m. Her cell phone indicated that the message was from Apr 18 at 11:04 p.m. At exactly 11:04 p.m. on April 18, Yumi receives a call from Yoko. During that call, Yoko goes through the very same chit-chat as was on her previous voice mail. As Yumi suddenly realizes what might happen next, she hears Yoko shriek into the phone. Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko's severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji's  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi's house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi's feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi's phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi's apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi's reflection in nearby mirror, it's Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she'll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to \"take care of\" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.\n",

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney.

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

During a tense conversation with Rosetta, Melora learns that her daughter Krista had been a prostitute, that she bore a daughter, and that Melora's late husband had sexually abused her own daughter Krista. The following day, Melora takes Krista's daughter home with her. *The Dead Girl: Krista buys her daughter a stuffed animal for her third birthday. One of her johns, Tarlow, promises to drive her to Norwalk, where her daughter is, but he backs out at the last minute.

Krista vandalizes Tommy's car and, when he tries to stop her, she beats him up and leaves on a borrowed motorcycle.

He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

            "In Tokyo, during an evening get-together with friends, Okazaki Yoko's  cell phone suddenly rings in an eerie, unusual tone, cartoon styled. Not recognizing the tone, Yoko doesn't pick up soon enough and the call goes into \"voice mail\" . When she sees that the call/message was from her own phone number and dated two days into the future, both she and her friend Nakamura Yumi  listen intently to the message. What they hear is the voice of Yoko in casual chit-chat, followed by a horrendous scream and then dead silence, which visibly disturbs Yoko and Yumi. The two girls attempt to laugh the message off and even share the story with their friends, who are just as clueless as them. She tells her friends that she received the call to her cell phone on Apr 16 at 11:04 p.m. Her cell phone indicated that the message was from Apr 18 at 11:04 p.m. At exactly 11:04 p.m. on April 18, Yumi receives a call from Yoko. During that call, Yoko goes through the very same chit-chat as was on her previous voice mail. As Yumi suddenly realizes what might happen next, she hears Yoko shriek into the phone. Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko's severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji's  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi's house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi's feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi's phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi's apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi's reflection in nearby mirror, it's Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she'll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to \"take care of\" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.\n",

            "Aurore Gagnon, born in 1909 to Marie-Anne Caron and Telesphore Gagnon, is the second child of the couple. During the first nine years of her life, Aurore enjoys a happy life. Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney. When the peace judge and several others, including doctors, arrive at Aurore's home, it is too late: she collapsed on the stairs and was attacked again by Marie-Anne with a 2X4. Doctors are unable to save Aurore, who passes away from blood poisoning. After Aurore's funeral, the couple is arrested for Aurore's death. Telesphore is sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter. His cousin and wife Marie-Anne is initially sentenced to death by hanging for second degree murder. She is then given a life sentence, but health issues force her to leave the jail, and she later dies from breast and brain cancer. Father Leduc, whom Oreus blames for his lack of action on the case, kills himself with explosives.\n",

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

            "The plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

Another woman seems to be stalking the couple from her position in a nearby car, and when Susan is left alone in the room for just a few moments, she has a violent fantasy of a strange man leaping out of the closet and raping her. When her husband returns she insists on leaving, and so they do. The couple arrives at a house where the husband apparently grew up. This is where the rest of the story unfolds. The wife sees the woman from the hotel in the woods on the property but she does not tell her husband. Susan notices in the house that there are paintings up of male ancestors but none of the wives. She is told by the servants' daughter that the wives' paintings are in the cellar. Susan notices that one of the paintings of the wives has the face cut out of it. Susan's husband tells her that the woman in the painting is named Mircalla Karnstein, one of his ancestors, who two hundred years before murdered her husband on their wedding night because he supposedly made her commit unspeakable acts. Susan has violent dreams involving the mysterious woman she has been seeing. She wakes up and finds a dagger under her pillow. At his point, Susan starts to become detached from her husband. The husband calls on a doctor to figure out why she is having all of these dreams and what is wrong with her. Soon Mircalla is invading Susan's dreams, persuading her to use a mysterious dagger, which keeps reappearing no matter where it is hidden, to butcher Susan's husband as Mircalla did hers. One day while strolling out on the beach, the husband discovers a naked woman buried in the sand, with only her snorkel providing air. He digs her out and takes her home where she reveals herself to be Carmilla. Susan falls under the spell of Carmilla, a man-hating vampire who seduces Susan and puts the bite on her to drink her blood and possess her in a lesbian relationship. The husband finally catches on that Carmilla is really his ancestor Mircalla Karnstein and a vampire, and that his life is in danger. The repressed Susan's desires are awakened in the intense lesbian love affair and she embarks on a spree of bloody mayhem. They kill the doctor, the guardian of the property, and they try to kill the husband too, but he kills them while the two women are resting in their coffins as vampires.  After this happens, the servant's daughter arrives, and reveals that she was bitten too; she then kneels and allows the husband to shoot her once in the head. He returns to the coffin with a dagger, and the scene cuts to a newspaper column declaring, \"Man cuts out the hearts of three women,\" suggesting the husband was found and arrested for three murders.\n",

            "It is 1940. When the movie begins, film star Viviane Denvert sits in the audience of a premiere of her new movie and notices a man who keeps staring at her. She is disturbed, and when the film is over and the audience has finished praising her, she rushes home, discovering that she is pursued by that same man. He chases her into her apartment. An hour later, Frédéric Auger, a young writer, receives a call from Viviane, who was his childhood crush. Viviane, who has long used Frédéric's devotion, asks him to come to her apartment immediately. Upon arriving, he discovers a corpse, \"accidentally\" killed, which Viviane asks him to dispose of, claiming that the man had been harassing her and when she slapped him, he had fallen over the edge of the balcony. He agrees to help her and the two pack the corpse into the trunk of his car; however, as it is raining, he accidentally drives into a curb and hits a police signalling device . The trunk opens upon impact, revealing the dead body to the arriving police and so, Frederic is arrested and sent to prison. On the eve of the German occupation of Paris, all of the city's citizens evacuate, including the prisoners. Prisoners are paired up with another and hand cuffed together. Frédéric and his cellmate Raoul take advantage of the confusion to escape. Frédéric then takes the train to Bordeaux, where he learns that Viviane is. It so happens that Raoul is also on the train and he leads Frederic to a seat near another girl, Camille. Camille turns out to be a student of a physics professor; the two of them are guarding French stocks of heavy water that they must ship to England before the Germans can get their hands on it and create an atomic bomb. The remainder of the film traces the confused adventures of the characters as they evade the Germans and seek rest and companionship. \"Bon Voyage\" takes on the challenge of the dire topic of war and situates a charming group of characters across France's occupation as a backdrop, and the intertwined relationships and various coincidences with the characters make the film very entertaining. As some decide to stay in France and make good of the German occupation, others go underground or decide to escape to London. In a very short scene, a quite recognizable General Charles de Gaulle is told \"Bon voyage\" by one of his aides. As Frédéric becomes involved in the French Résistance, he eventually falls for Camille. At the end of the film, Frederic returns from England to meet with Camille at an outdoor cafe. When Germans recognize them, the couple flees and sneak into a movie theatre. When Frederic sees one of their pursuers enter the theater and search for their faces, he turns and kisses Camille. They stop once their pursuer leaves. Frederic looks up at the screen and is surprised to see Viviane singing and dancing, signifying that she has once again risen as a movie star. However, Frederic turns to Camille, and they resume kissing as the film comes to a close.\n",

            "On April's fourteenth birthday, Marion, her adoptive mother, gives her earrings, not the mobile phone she wanted. They argue, and April leaves for school. After lying to her friends, claiming she has a phone and is going to the dentist's, April chooses to play truant. While at work at a stately home, Marion hears that April has not arrived at school. She talks to her friend and colleague Elliot, who unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her from leaving. April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting telling the story of her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. In a flashback, a young April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship is an abusive one, leading to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realises that they were lied to. April then leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and, in a shopping centre, meets Elliot, who has joined her. April then visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year old April lives at the Sunnyholme. Cared for by a woman named Mo, April befriends an older girl called Gina and is introduced to Pearl, a girl of her age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April. Gina wakes April one night to involve her in a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water, and then tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, who she pushes down a flight of stairs, and is reprimanded by Mo. A voice-over from 14-year-old April says Gina was then \"moved on\", and, eventually, April is also moved on. The flashback jumps forward to April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean . A piece of work on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from going out on a Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number on the side of a dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her real mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.\n",

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral.

When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal.

Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten.

The little girl, named Sandy, responds by stating, \"I don't remember.\" Years later, Sandy Channing  and her brother, Eli , are both academic students with scholarships to Stanford University. They go to a party at night at their friend T.J.'s house, and they and their friends go to the graveyard to play a game. As they are about to start, a girl about their age  asks to play. They allow her, and they play a different version of tag, where one of them is a ghost, and whoever the ghost tags becomes a ghost until there is one left. Eli, who is the ghost, and the others tag everyone, leaving the unnamed girl the winner. As Sandy tells her that she's won, the girl asks if she remembers her. Sandy tells her she doesn't, with the girl stating, \"You will,\" before jumping from the cliff behind her. The police arrive but are unable to find a body. The group then decides to call it a night and go home. The next day, Layla  and Chad  are on the side of the road after having sex in Chad's car, with Chad telling Layla he wants to break up. Furious, Layla throws his class ring, which was hanging on her necklace, into the lake. With Chad driving off and leaving her alone at the lake, Layla goes into the water to retrieve the necklace when she sees a girl seemingly drown. When Layla swims to the buoy to look for the girl, it's as if the girl was never there and she swims back toward the shore. However, before she can get out of the water, she sees the girl floating lifelessly in front of her. Leaning down to see if the girl is okay, Layla is pulled into the water and drowned by the girl, who is revealed to be a demon-like incarnation of the unnamed girl who had disappeared the night before. Meanwhile, Chad arrives at Sandy and Eli's house with a different girl in tow, candy striper Cecilia . Looking on in disgust, Sandy asks what would Layla think, with Chad replying, \"Who?\" Before anything else happens, Chad leaves to take Cecilia back to the hospital. As the rest of the group is waiting for T.J.  to get off of work, T.J. is negotiating a deal to buy an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Lex . After bartering his paycheck for the ring, T.J. is asked to check the safety on machines one, two, and three before going home. As he is alone, he opts to smoke a little pot before doing so. After checking the safety on the first two machines, T.J. believes he sees someone at the other end of the warehouse before deducting it was an hallucination, stating, \"Note to self: drugs are bad.\" However, he is soon scared by the sight of the demonic Layla and gets his caught in the machine , before having his head pushed into the machine by the unnamed demonic girl. Just after this, Jake  remembers he forgot to get beer for their trip, to which Sandy replies that T.J. was supposed to be bringing it. However, just like Layla, the rest of the group has no memory of T.J. and Sandy decides to call him, only to find his contact information erased from her cellphone. Just then, Jake and Lex's dad, Sheriff Mitchell , pulls up in his patrol car to drop off Lex. Opting to go on with their spring break trip to the beach, the group stops at a convenience, with Lex distracting the cashier by having sex with him in the backroom while the rest of the friends steal liquor and food. Frustrated with Lex's seemingly promiscuous behavior despite dating T.J., Sandy walks off while Eli and Hannah  look on. Going after Sandy, Jake asks who T.J. is and calls Chad to check to make sure he is on his way. After hanging up, however, Chad is killed when the ghosts scare him into flipping his car, with the unnamed girl making it explode. Leaving the store, the group gets into Eli's Jeep with Sandy asking Jake where his bike went, to which responds that he had left it at her house. Once on the road, Sandy becomes even more confused when her stuff and the beach gear are gone, but her friends look at her confusingly, asking why they would be taking a boogie board to the mountains for spring break. Just then, Sandy yells at Eli to pull the car over, with Sandy getting out to look at Chad's car, battered and dirty in a junkyard. However, for some strange reason, no one but Sandy remembers who Chad is, and they soon drive to T.J.'s house, which appears vacant and in ruin, the apparent scene of some unknown crime of some sort, as there is caution tape around the house and yard. As Sandy goes into the house with her boyfriend Jake and her brother Eli, the other girls, Lex and Hannah, get into an argument in the car. At the same time, Sandy begins to remember the unnamed girl from the graveyard as her friend when she was little, but nothing more. Later, Lex is killed by what appears to be undead versions of her murdered friends, with Sandy witnessing her demise. The other three think Sandy is losing her mind, as none of the others remember Lex anymore. Sandy and the others go to the police station, where they learn the mysterious girl's name is Angela Smith and she lives in a convent. Sandy begs her friends to go with her, and they agree, but also agree to wait until morning. At a local hotel, Sandy sleeps due to a sleeping pill in her drink while Hannah and Eli go to the pool and have sex. Eli goes back up to the room to find Jake trying to contain Sandy who is throwing herself around in the room. Hannah is killed, and Sandy and Jake are now alone in the hotel room. Eli calls Sandy and tells her he can no longer cover for her. She then tells him to meet her at the convent. She and Jake then discover Angela is in a coma. At the convent, Jake is killed. Eli, who doesn't remember Jake, picks up a shaken Sandy. Sandy cries over her dead boyfriend, and Eli begins to realize that they are being erased in time, just like the rhyme they sang before playing the game in the graveyard. After heading home, Sandy, whose parents believe she has become depressed and suicidal, is sedated and taken to the hospital. While there, Eli is attacked and killed by the undead versions of his murdered friends. As Sandy is sedated again once at the hospital, she asks for Eli, of whom her parents have no recollection at all. Asking if Eli is a friend of hers, Sandy's parents tells the doctor that she has no friends. Later, Sandy dreams of a time where she and her friends played a scary prank on Angela , who had a seizure in front of the convent after knocking her head into the door. It is soon revealed that the little girl at the beginning of the film is a young Sandy, and the girl who mysteriously vanished and who has been committing the murders is, in fact, Angela. Sandy awakes and, recalling the rhyme to \"kill the ghost or seal your fate,\" goes to Angela's room and switches off her life support. Leaving the room, she hears beats from Angela's cardiac monitor and returns to the room, only to find Angela sitting up in her bed. Sandy is then chased up to the roof by the ghosts of her friends, and encounters the young version of Angela. Despite a failed attempt to reason with her, Sandy falls from the roof of the hospital. The film ends with Angela \"miraculously\" awaking from her coma, while Sandy is revealed to have taken her place in a coma of her own. The mystery about Eli & the friends is not revealed whether they were imaginary people or real.\n",

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

            "The plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

            "It is 1940. When the movie begins, film star Viviane Denvert sits in the audience of a premiere of her new movie and notices a man who keeps staring at her. She is disturbed, and when the film is over and the audience has finished praising her, she rushes home, discovering that she is pursued by that same man. He chases her into her apartment. An hour later, Frédéric Auger, a young writer, receives a call from Viviane, who was his childhood crush. Viviane, who has long used Frédéric's devotion, asks him to come to her apartment immediately. Upon arriving, he discovers a corpse, \"accidentally\" killed, which Viviane asks him to dispose of, claiming that the man had been harassing her and when she slapped him, he had fallen over the edge of the balcony. He agrees to help her and the two pack the corpse into the trunk of his car; however, as it is raining, he accidentally drives into a curb and hits a police signalling device . The trunk opens upon impact, revealing the dead body to the arriving police and so, Frederic is arrested and sent to prison. On the eve of the German occupation of Paris, all of the city's citizens evacuate, including the prisoners. Prisoners are paired up with another and hand cuffed together. Frédéric and his cellmate Raoul take advantage of the confusion to escape. Frédéric then takes the train to Bordeaux, where he learns that Viviane is. It so happens that Raoul is also on the train and he leads Frederic to a seat near another girl, Camille. Camille turns out to be a student of a physics professor; the two of them are guarding French stocks of heavy water that they must ship to England before the Germans can get their hands on it and create an atomic bomb. The remainder of the film traces the confused adventures of the characters as they evade the Germans and seek rest and companionship. \"Bon Voyage\" takes on the challenge of the dire topic of war and situates a charming group of characters across France's occupation as a backdrop, and the intertwined relationships and various coincidences with the characters make the film very entertaining. As some decide to stay in France and make good of the German occupation, others go underground or decide to escape to London. In a very short scene, a quite recognizable General Charles de Gaulle is told \"Bon voyage\" by one of his aides. As Frédéric becomes involved in the French Résistance, he eventually falls for Camille. At the end of the film, Frederic returns from England to meet with Camille at an outdoor cafe. When Germans recognize them, the couple flees and sneak into a movie theatre. When Frederic sees one of their pursuers enter the theater and search for their faces, he turns and kisses Camille. They stop once their pursuer leaves. Frederic looks up at the screen and is surprised to see Viviane singing and dancing, signifying that she has once again risen as a movie star. However, Frederic turns to Camille, and they resume kissing as the film comes to a close.\n",

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

            "Aurore Gagnon, born in 1909 to Marie-Anne Caron and Telesphore Gagnon, is the second child of the couple. During the first nine years of her life, Aurore enjoys a happy life. Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney. When the peace judge and several others, including doctors, arrive at Aurore's home, it is too late: she collapsed on the stairs and was attacked again by Marie-Anne with a 2X4. Doctors are unable to save Aurore, who passes away from blood poisoning. After Aurore's funeral, the couple is arrested for Aurore's death. Telesphore is sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter. His cousin and wife Marie-Anne is initially sentenced to death by hanging for second degree murder. She is then given a life sentence, but health issues force her to leave the jail, and she later dies from breast and brain cancer. Father Leduc, whom Oreus blames for his lack of action on the case, kills himself with explosives.\n",

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

            "The film is a contemporary  picture that takes place in New York City. The story involves a mad scientist who turns circumstances on a young man to do his bidding. Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

Arden gets into a fight with her mother, which compels her to finally leave home. Arden has her date with Rudy. In the morning, Arden calls the police to report a woman  left alone at home. *The Sister: Leah is prepping the dead woman in the morgue when she notices a certain birthmark. Leah suspects that the dead woman is her sister, Jenny, who was taken from a nearby park fifteen years ago. She asks the sheriff to match the dental records. She is certain the dead woman is her missing sister, but Leah's parents refuse to believe their daughter Jenny is dead. The sheriff delivers the test result: the dead woman is NOT Jenny. *The Wife: Ruth is angry that her husband, Carl, constantly leaves her alone night after night. The next morning, she discovers clothing, wallets, and ID's in ziplock bags inside a storage unit that is supposedly empty. She matches the IDs to names in the newspapers of the serial killer's victims. Carl comes back late at night with scratches on his neck. After another argument, he leaves the house to go to the car outside. He pulls a trash bag out of the trunk and goes to the storage unit. Ruth asks Carl if he knows anything about the dead women, and he says no. Later that night, Ruth enters the unit and pulls everything out. She drives to the police station, but doesn't follow through with her plan to present the evidence she found to the authorities; instead Ruth returns home to burn the evidence. *The Mother: The dead woman has been identified as Krista Kutcher. Melora, Krista's mother, is notified. Melora goes to Krista's previous house and finds Rosetta, Krista's former roommate.

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

            "In Tokyo, during an evening get-together with friends, Okazaki Yoko's  cell phone suddenly rings in an eerie, unusual tone, cartoon styled. Not recognizing the tone, Yoko doesn't pick up soon enough and the call goes into \"voice mail\" . When she sees that the call/message was from her own phone number and dated two days into the future, both she and her friend Nakamura Yumi  listen intently to the message. What they hear is the voice of Yoko in casual chit-chat, followed by a horrendous scream and then dead silence, which visibly disturbs Yoko and Yumi. The two girls attempt to laugh the message off and even share the story with their friends, who are just as clueless as them. She tells her friends that she received the call to her cell phone on Apr 16 at 11:04 p.m. Her cell phone indicated that the message was from Apr 18 at 11:04 p.m. At exactly 11:04 p.m. on April 18, Yumi receives a call from Yoko. During that call, Yoko goes through the very same chit-chat as was on her previous voice mail. As Yumi suddenly realizes what might happen next, she hears Yoko shriek into the phone. Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko's severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji's  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi's house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi's feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi's phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi's apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi's reflection in nearby mirror, it's Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she'll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to \"take care of\" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.\n",

            "Aurore Gagnon, born in 1909 to Marie-Anne Caron and Telesphore Gagnon, is the second child of the couple. During the first nine years of her life, Aurore enjoys a happy life. Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay , discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney. When the peace judge and several others, including doctors, arrive at Aurore's home, it is too late: she collapsed on the stairs and was attacked again by Marie-Anne with a 2X4. Doctors are unable to save Aurore, who passes away from blood poisoning. After Aurore's funeral, the couple is arrested for Aurore's death. Telesphore is sentenced to life in prison for manslaughter. His cousin and wife Marie-Anne is initially sentenced to death by hanging for second degree murder. She is then given a life sentence, but health issues force her to leave the jail, and she later dies from breast and brain cancer. Father Leduc, whom Oreus blames for his lack of action on the case, kills himself with explosives.\n",

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments.

Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him.

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life.

During the London blitz of World War II, Vera Phillips  runs into her first love, a charismatic Welsh poet Dylan Thomas . Their feelings for each other are rekindled, despite the fact that Dylan is now married to and has a child with the spirited Caitlin Macnamara . In spite of their initial rivalry, the two women become best friends, and, drinking heavily in wartime London, the three get along well. At this time, William Killick , a British soldier smitten by Vera, pursues her. They fall in love and marry, but soon after William is posted to war. Vera gives birth to his baby, and she and the Thomases move to the Welsh seashore to raise their children in two small, neighboring cottages where Vera and Caitlin's friendship grows ever closer. One day, however, Dylan enamors Vera into an affair. William, scarred by the horrors of war, eventually returns home where Vera notices his emotional distance and instability. In his disquiet, William grows suspicious of his wife's infidelity. Severely drunk one night, and angry with Dylan's friends' ignorant discourse of war, he returns home and fires multiple shots into the Thomas' house, though he hits no one. In the morning, he is arrested by the British police and taken to trial. During the trial, Dylan testifies against William by exaggerating the facts, stating he believed Killick was not only sober, but also that Killick intended to kill him, his wife, and his child. The jury finds William innocent of intent to murder, and he returns home. He accepts his new role as a father, and Vera forgives him, rekindling their relationship. Soon after, the Thomases move out of their cottage. During the farewell, Vera, unable to forgive him for testifying against her husband, ignores Dylan, but Vera and Caitlin restore their friendship, remaining close friends.\n",

            "Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn  giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius , the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future. Sister James ([[Amy Adams , a young and naïve teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius. Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and  James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged. Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller  shocks Sister Aloysius with her disinterest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of. Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches , who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands. Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that \"in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.\" Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: \"I have doubts...I have such doubts.\" And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.\n",

            "The plot involves the romances of musical comedy stars, set against the backstage hubbub of a Broadway revue. Anita Page and Bessie Love play a vaudeville sister act who have come to New York for their big break on Broadway. Charles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister  is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister . Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous \"stage door Johnny.\" The movie opens with Eddie Kearns debuting “The Broadway Melody.” He tells some chorus girls he’s brought the Mahoney Sisters to New York to perform it with him in Francis Zanfield’s latest revue. Hank and Queenie Mahoney are awaiting Eddie’s arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to be stars. Their Uncle Jed arrives to tell them he’s gotten them a job with a 30-week traveling show. Hank tells him they’re not interested but he says he’ll give them time to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to rehearsal for Zanfield’s revue to present their act. Zanfield isn’t interested in it but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well. She also convinces him to pretend Hank’s business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During dress rehearsal for the revue Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for “The Broadway Melody” and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another girl is injured after falling off a prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques “Jock” Warriner. While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent. Over the next couple weeks Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she’s setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister’s heart, runs off to Jock once again. Hank, after witnessing Queenie’s fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she’d only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show. There’s a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie but he insists they spend time alone. When she resists his advances he says it’s the least she could do after all he’s done for her. He begins to get physical but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind. Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the arrival of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she’s through with show business and will settle down in their new house on Long Island. She insists that Hank lives with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that her sister hasn’t found the happiness she deserves. The final scene is of a distraught Hank on her way to the train station.\n",

            "Notorious gunslinger George Kelby Jr.  and his wife Dora  settle down in a peaceful little town of Cross Creek under assumed identities to avoid having to continually face men out to become famous for shooting down the \"fastest gun alive\". George becomes a mild-mannered teetotal shopkeeper little respected by the other townsfolk. One day, the whole town hears the news that outlaw Vinnie Harold  has gunned down Clint Fallon, reputedly the \"fastest gun in the west\", and he listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called \"fast guns\". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a \"ribbon clerk\". HIs pride stung, he goes back to his store, retrieves his gun from hiding , belts it on, and - over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built - says \"they have to know who I am\" and goes to the bar. The men are astonished - and a little afraid - at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had, and finally blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive... \"...faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him.\" When the citizens disbelieve him, he takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three by two men. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from a man's hand at twenty feet, hitting it almost immediately after it left the man's hand. Meanwhile, while everyone is in the church where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold has come to town and finds out about George's display of gun skill from a local boy. Even though he is on the run---and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope  and Dink Wells , who just want to escape the law---Harold decides to stay and face George. Vinnie finds out that the \"fast gun\" is in the church and sends Swope to the church to call him out so his boss can meet him. When the town refuses to send out \"the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time\", Harold sends Dink out to find some kerosene and pour it over all the building in town, and then orders Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if the fast gun doesn't come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town unless George faces him. The townspeople now \"forget\" their oath and try to force George into the street. George now has to tell the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle is actually his father's  and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for awhile, but rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out—but without any of the loot. Swope leaves, toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie. He thinks better of it and leaves, just before George exits the church to face Vinnie. But with no other choice, George forces down his fear and goes out into the street, where he outdraws and kills Harold. When a posse pursuing the outlaws shows up, the townspeople, who are attending the burial of Harold and Kelby, claim that Kelby and Harold shot each other dead. After the posse leaves, it's revealed that Kelby wasn't killed and that a coffin filled with stones, Kelby's gun, and Kelby's reputation as \"the fastest gun alive,\" was buried. This allows George and Dora to resume their peaceful existence in Cross Creek.\n",

The bar's patrons perk up when the man mentions that the mariachi was looking for a man named \"Bucho.\" Later, the American man visits the Mariachi telling him that the bar is a good starting place to look for Bucho. Meanwhile, the bartender alerts Bucho that a \"man in black\" is looking for him and Bucho increases his security. El Mariachi arrives in town, and befriends a young boy. Entering the bar he is recognized by the patrons, employees of Bucho, and engages in a gunfight with them, killing all but one. As he exits, he is tailed by the sole survivor, who manages to wound him before being killed. During the meeting with the survivor, he saves beautiful bookstore owner, Carolina, and passes out. When he wakes up, his wounds are being tended by Carolina  the owner of the bookstore. He also finds out that Bucho holds control over Carolina and the entire town, paying them to hide his illegal activities. Later, he meets with his American friend at a nearby church; but, as they exit, they are attacked by the assassin Navajas , who kills the American and wounds El Mariachi with a set of throwing knives.

Later, at a hotel, El Mariachi tells Carolina she can leave the village and use the money she stashed to start a new life, but she tells him that the money was hidden in the books that were burned. He then decides to call his friends Campa ([[Carlos Gallardo  and Quino , who meet up with him and go to a deserted part of town for a showdown with Bucho's men.

            "In Tokyo, during an evening get-together with friends, Okazaki Yoko's  cell phone suddenly rings in an eerie, unusual tone, cartoon styled. Not recognizing the tone, Yoko doesn't pick up soon enough and the call goes into \"voice mail\" . When she sees that the call/message was from her own phone number and dated two days into the future, both she and her friend Nakamura Yumi  listen intently to the message. What they hear is the voice of Yoko in casual chit-chat, followed by a horrendous scream and then dead silence, which visibly disturbs Yoko and Yumi. The two girls attempt to laugh the message off and even share the story with their friends, who are just as clueless as them. She tells her friends that she received the call to her cell phone on Apr 16 at 11:04 p.m. Her cell phone indicated that the message was from Apr 18 at 11:04 p.m. At exactly 11:04 p.m. on April 18, Yumi receives a call from Yoko. During that call, Yoko goes through the very same chit-chat as was on her previous voice mail. As Yumi suddenly realizes what might happen next, she hears Yoko shriek into the phone. Suddenly, Yoko is then violently thrown by an invisible force through a chain link fence and onto a speeding commuter train down below just passing by, decapitating her. Then, as Yoko's severed arm still holds the phone, the finger suddenly begins to dial a randomly picked phone number, and she also vomits a strange red candy. Kawai Kenji's  phone is next to receive a call and, like Yoko, misses it. He receives a voice message with himself cursing and then a loud scream, Yumi is with him and hears it too. Kenji saw a friend that he had to meet with and he said the same words of the message and then the doors of the elevator opened without the cabin, and as they but looked on, he was pulled into the shaft and plummets with the same screams of the message. He falls to his death at the bottom of the elevator and he vomits a red candy. His phone is still working on its own looking for another victim to kill. Konichi Natsumi  is at Yumi's house and her phone rings with a strange video of her and a body behind her. She then goes to a TV program for an exorcism. Yumi meets Hirochi Yamashita and with the help of him they go to the TV program. The exorcism is a complete disaster and the video of Natsumi becomes real. Yumi and Yamashita came to save Natsumi, but when they get to Natsumi her right hand turns to the back, her complete arm turns to the back of her neck and turns until her head falls off. Her decapitated body still walks and eventually falls down on the floor. A red candy comes out of her mouth that stops at Yumi's feet and the chilling ring tone sounds on Yumi's phone. Yumi and Yamashita investigate the phone calls in an old hospital and they find a dead body of a woman with a phone that comes to life. The body is of Marie Mizunuma , the mother of Mimiko  and Nanako, who they believe to be the killer ghost. The body comes to life when Yumi lays eyes upon it and begins to advance towards Yumi. Yamashita comes to the aid of Yumi but they are separated on either side of a door by the same force that killed Yoko, leaving Yumi trapped in the room with the ghost-corpse of Mizunuma and Yamashita helplessly looking on through a barred window at the side of the door. The ghost-corpse comes for Yumi and comes to strangle her to death. Yumi apologizes to Marie, crying and saying she will never leave her mother again, with Marie believing Yumi is her daughter. After the incident the police have arrived and have seen to Yumi and Yamashita. An investigator talks to the pair and insists that Yamashita come to the orphanage where Mimiko and Nanako dwelt, for they have discovered some important evidence they need him to see. In Yumi's apartment she is haunted by Mimiko and Yamashita comes to save her, but Yumi stabs Yamashita in the stomach. As Yamashita collapses onto the floor he sees that instead of Yumi's reflection in nearby mirror, it's Mimiko, who turns to look at him, indicating that Mimiko has possessed Yumi. The vision of Mimiko says that she'll take him to the hospital, much as she did for her sister while she was alive. Later, Yamashita wakes up in the hospital with Yumi in the room with a knife hiding behind her back. It turns out that Mimiko, not Marie, was abusing Nanako all along. She leans forward and gives him the same kind of red candy that appeared with all of the victims, then waits. When Yamashita seems to enjoy the candy, Yumi smiles, and the spirit of Mimiko has obviously found another person to \"take care of\" as she did with her little sister. The film ends with the song Ikutsuka no Sora by Kou Shibasaki.\n",

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops tuberculosis. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne , with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat Telesphore's children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife. Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her stepmother and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame her for their deaths. The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the mistreatment becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a 2X4 with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten.

            "Anna Hart was always an odd child—a genius desperately afraid of flickering lights, hair parted perfectly down the middle, and with strange prophetic dreams. Simultaneously, several strange things begin to happen. A mysterious neighbor named Michaela Dupont  moves in next door to the Harts. And, most frightening of all, Anna sees her exact double on television one night . As her investigation of the other Anna—Anna Smithson—progresses, she begins to learn the truth: the truth about a woman named Anna Zimmerman who has been dead for twenty years, and most important, the truth about herself: that she was part of a cloning experiment by Zimmerman to create the perfect girl, one who would grow into a duplicate of Zimmerman herself, right down to the traits that Anna indeed shares with her. It also turns out that her mother volunteered for the cloning project but the father wanted nothing to do with it. We also learn, through Anna's dreams, of Zimmerman's past; growing up during World War II as a Jew in Nazi-controlled Germany, where she, like the present Anna, was a pianist and child prodigy who would play a part in the Nazis' plans for the genetic engineering of humans. But, just as the current Anna is beginning to act normal and learn more about her background—thanks in part to her brother Rowan and to secret assistance from Micheala—we also learn of six other Annas, this after her mother told her that they  wanted to re-evaluate Anna for a few days at a facility at Albacore Island. While there, Anna becomes suspicious when the phone in her room is blocked. Also, as she snoops around she notices the experiments they are performing. When Rowan has not heard from Anna, he sneaks into the facility to see his sister. Anna and Rowan confront Dr. Henry Jelliff, the person who kept Zimmerman's genetic cloning experiments alive at Albacore Island, who tells her that she is now a 'normal' person and suggests that she should change her name as a way to start a new life. But, after Anna and her brother were free to go, Jelliff reveals to Michaela, whom he suspected was not following her assignments, that he is secretly grooming yet another Anna to grow up to become the future Zimmerman; they plan to kill the remaining five Annas, including Hart and her family, shortly. Jelliff's plans to eliminate the girls backfire when Michaela reveals herself to him as Anna Parkhurst, the original product of Zimmerman's cloning experiment ; and, like her Mother/Creator, she knows how to create the replicator. Because Jelliff had her parents killed and because she is enraged by the experiments, the adult Anna turns the table on him by offering him the plans for the replicator in return for the safety of all of the Annas. The film ends with Jeliff considering Michaela/Anna's offer.\n",

            " May 21, 1973: Six people are conducting The Charles Experiment; a para-pyschological experiment. They look at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, and with all of them concentrating at the same time, they hope to be able to summon his spirit into the room. Years later, four college students, Patrick , Lydia , Greg , and Ben  attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology to amplify their concentration over 400 times the original. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall. The movie switches to Ben's girlfriend Kelly  who lives in a nearly empty subdivision along with their neighbors Mike , his young daughter Maggie  and their dog Pepper. One evening, Ben and Kelly discover strange burn marks on their counters. They lock the doors, but Kelly awakens in the middle of the night to find both doors wide open. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds that Pepper has wandered into her house. As she follows him, he walks into the laundry room and collapses. The dog is taken to the vet, where it dies. Returning home, Kelly notices the floor in the laundry room has begun peeling. She removes some of the linoleum and finds a large amount of mold and spores, Ben finds even more in a crawlspace. Later, Ben finds 36 \"Urgent\" emails from Patrick in his inbox that first invite him to a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that \"containment failed\" and finally \"you are in danger\". Attachments to the emails include footage of the new experiment, this time amplifying their signal to that of 4000 people. Kelly calls for Ben and shows him her closet, in which all of the clothes have been trashed. They begin to hear noises throughout the house. Ben talks Kelly into camping in the yard and agrees to keep watch overnight. During the night, Ben leaves his watch post in the tent to investigate a noise. While he is gone, three of the camera feeds to the surveillance monitor go blank. The last remaining camera falls to the ground and begins to move towards the sleeping Kelly. The next day, while Kelly is gone, Ben finds another large chunk of mold growing. He prods at it with a broom, causing it to break open and reveal a figurine inside that had been used during the previous experiment. Later, Kelly discovers Ben's equipment from the experiment, including a recording of Lydia's disappearance. She confronts Ben, who admits to taking part in it and apologizes for not telling her sooner. After witnessing another appearance by the apparition, they decide to stay at a hotel, but they're attacked there as well and flee. While on the run, they receive a call from Patrick and agree to meet with him. Once together, Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent spirit entity to enter their world and further attempts to contain it have failed. Patrick also mentions he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from the spirit. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity, this time using the city's power to simulate the power of 400,000 people. While setting up, Kelly becomes trapped in the laundry room with the spirit, but it disappears. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abrutply stops. While Kelly and Ben are cleaning out the house, Patrick is pulled into darkness and vanishes. They return to find his chair empty and various objects merged with parts of the house. Unable to find Patrick, the two leave for the safety chamber in Patrick's house. Inside Patrick's house, Ben and Kelly hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three simply disappeared. After entering and closing the cage, the lights go out, and when they come back Ben has disappeared. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse beyond the door. She leaves the house and sees her truck being absorbed into the ground as well. As Kelly wanders aimlessly, Patrick's narration explains that the first experiment made the group a beacon for the entity, while the second one helped it cross into their world. He further explains that it gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they're too weak to resist. As day breaks, Kelly's wandering leads to a Costco. Inside, she walks to the camping section, enters a tent, zips the door closed, and waits. Having given up resisting, a number of hands appear from behind and slowly grab hold of her as the movie cuts to black.\n",

            "A research team, including Joanne , Damon , Gary  and Phil , deploy small UAVs from a C130 Hercules, to interfere with a storm. At first the group celebrate a good result, however a large storm begins to develop. Meanwhile, Charlie , an ex-scientist, is in town to promote his new book, with his assistant Nora  in the  town of Harrisford, Oregon. As Charlie does a book signing at a local book shop, the storm hits the town. Charlie and Nora narrowly escape death; however, the storm kills many others. Just outside town, a young couple Eric  and Ashley  are traveling to meet with Charlie as part of their university course. Eric notices a strange weather pattern however Ashley takes no notice, as she is in a rush to get to the book signing. In town, Nora is taken to hospital for injuries while Charlie meets up with his old friend Joanne and also Damon, who have rushed to the scene after their computers detected the storm. Joanne wishes to stop the program and so orders Damon to phone their backer Frank . However Frank tells Damon he will not stop the experiment until it has been completed and so allows the small UAVs to continue flying. Meanwhile, another storm freezes a farmer. Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the scene where they discover one of the UAVs that has crashed. Joanne tells Charlie about the experiment. Nora then phones Charlie. She is leaving town for the TV show Charlie has an appearance on later that day. Meanwhile, Eric and Ashley arrive at the book signing to discover it has finished and begin to leave town. Charlie, Joanne and Damon travel back to their experiment site, where they meet up with Gary and Phil. Charlie comes up with a theory of how the UAVs are causing the storms, and Damon tells Joanne Frank has not aborted the experiment. Angrily, Joanne phones Frank to warn him, but Frank rejects her calls. As Eric and Ashley leave town, a tornado forms. Nora's car is hit by debris. After the tornado disappears, Eric and Ashley walk back to town. At the experiment site, another tornado hits. The group flee but Phil is killed. They go to a nearby hotel where they discover Frank has blocked them from deactivating the UAVs. Eric and Ashley break into a building where they decide to change their presentation to the freak weather after Eric caught it on camera. The group come across wreckage where they discover Nora's body. A furious Joanne blames Damon for not making Frank finish the experiment. As Charlie mourns Nora's death, another storm hits, forcing the group to flee. After a plane that Frank sent into the sky crashes, he wishes to deactivate the UAVs; however, Bill  informs him they are not responding. The group travel to the same building Eric and Ashley are at, and Gary begins to try and deactivate the UAVs. They realize the storms will reach populated areas very soon and warn Frank, who allows the UAVs to be destroyed. However, the storm continues to grow despite the UAVs having been destroyed. While Eric and Ashley send out signals to warn people, Charlie, Joanne and Damon rush to the university to use its satellite to punch a hole in the ozone layer to extinguish the storms. While arriving, Damon is killed by large hailstones. Meanwhile Gary manages to connect to a satellite in space. The plan works and the storms are extinguished. Eric and Ashley help Charlie and Joanne put Frank in prison for manipulating the team into creating a weapon.\n",

            "The film is a contemporary  picture that takes place in New York City. The story involves a mad scientist who turns circumstances on a young man to do his bidding. Robert Sandell , despondent over his ill luck as a writer, and his mother's declining health, attacks and attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb , a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell  on one consideration&nbsp;– that Robert shall at the end of eight days, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will, for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert agrees. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but by his wife , and a grotesque hunchback , whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold on Robert, not only gives him spending money, but assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter, Angela  and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault in which is a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are strange prisoners&nbsp;– previously failed experiment of Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert goes to the physician and tries to buy himself out of the bargain&nbsp;– for his book has been published, and he is now a successful writer. There is yet one day before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim may try to escape, seizes him, and straps him to the operating table. He is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, and the hunchback releases a cage door and the doctor is himself brought to a horrible end at the hands of an ape-man wrecked mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his \"blind bargain\", Robert returns to his home to learn that his writings have met with success and that Angela waits for him at the marriage ceremony.\n",

            "A general’s son is taken hostage and used as leverage to free a bandit leader. The general’s other offspring, a girl named Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue the son. When the bandit gang encounter the Golden Swallow in a local inn, the prisoner negotiation escalates to bloodshed and the goons are swiftly defeated. A local drunk beggar named Fan Da-Pei acts as Golden Swallow’s guardian angel, secretly helping her avoid being ambushed at night. That morning Fan Da-Pei, whom we now know only as “Drunken Cat” tips off Golden Swallow to the bandits whereabouts. They have occupied a Buddhist monastery. Under the guise of an acolyte, Golden Swallow penetrates the temple and confronts the man who’s taken her brother hostage. During the brawl she is injured by a deadly, poisoned dart. She escapes and is rescued in the woods by Fan who nurses her back to health. While she’s convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Fan is actually a martial arts master and a leader of a Kung Fu society, which he otherwise keeps a secret. The monastery is led by an evil abbot, Liao Kung, who is also a kung fu master and has allied himself with the bandits. He finds out that the beggar carries a bamboo staff, and then realises that the beggar is the former student of the same master. The abbot has in fact killed their master in order to get his bamboo staff, which was rescued by Fan Da-Pei. Now Liao Kung sees the opportunity to gain control of the staff. Fan Da-Pei is hesitant to confront Liao Kung for two reasons. First, Liao Kung’s kung fu skills are unparalleled, and he thinks he has no chances against him, or at the very least, one of them would not survive a confrontation. Second, despite his evil ways, Liao Kung has actually done a good deed to Fan Da-Pei: he persuaded the master to accept Fan Da-Pei into the Green Wand Kung-Fu school when he was a mere homeless orphan, thus giving him a chance in life. For this reason, Fan is reluctant to fight the abbot even though Fan knows about the abbot’s criminal deeds. In order to release the General’s son, Fan stages a prisoner exchange. During the exchange, the government soldiers receive the General’s son, but Fan prevents the bandits from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, fights off the bandits. The evil abbot forces a showdown with Fan Da-Pei.\n",

Για ομοιομορφία, μετατρέπουμε όλα τα tokens σε πεζούς χαρακτήρες.\n",

(πχ. μπορεί το string \"./#!\" να μην έγινε tokenized στα επιμέρους σημεία στίξης) Γι'αυτό χρησιμοποιουμε τη συνάρτηση `thorough_filter`, της οποίας ο κώδικας υπάρχει στο notebook για εισαγωγή στο text mining, του μαθήματος. Τη τροποποιήσαμε ώστε να αφαιρεί tokens που αποτελούνται απόκλειστικά από ψηφία ή/και σημεία στίξης. (Δεν χρησιμοποιούμε σκέτους αριθμούς για τον recommender.) Επίσης, αφαιρούμε tokens με μήκος μικρότερο του 2 διότι υπάρχουν ελάχιστες λέξεις της αγγλικής με 2 γράμματα που μπορούν να δώσουν χρήσιμο σημασιολογικό περιεχόμενο και \"διαχωρισιμότητα\".\n",

Για να το κάνουμε αυτό χρησιμοποιούμε το lemmatization της nltk που αντικαθιστά σημασιολογικά ισοδύναμα tokens με έναν αντιπρόσωπο. Αυτό γίνεται με χρήση προϋπάρχοντος vocabulary, το οποίο αποτελεί μέρος της nltk. Επιλέξαμε lemmatization έναντι stemming, ώστε στη συνέχεια που θα χρησιμοποιήσουμε word embeddings, να έχουμε \"υπαρκτά\" tokens και να μην υπάρχει κίνδυνος να μην εμφανίζονται στα embeddings που θα χρησιμοποιήσουμε, κάτι που παρατηρήσαμε να συμβαίνει πιο συχνά με stemming.\n",

After recently parting ways with her boyfriend when she caught him cheating, Hilary finds herself living with her eccentric mother . One day, Hilary answers an ad in a newspaper for a nurse only to find herself being escorted out before the interview starts. Victor Geddes  is a well-educated, rich, and shy 28 year-old. As the film progresses, Victor's health worsens progressively, due to leukemia. Despite his father's protests, Victor hires Hilary to be his live-in caretaker while he undergoes a traumatic course of chemotherapy. Hillary becomes insecure of her ability to care for Victor after her first exposure to the side effects of his chemotherapy treatment. She studies about leukemia and stocks healthier food in the kitchen. He is \"finished\" with his chemotherapy and suggests they take a vacation to the coast. They rent a house and she begins to feel that she's no longer needed to care for him. They fall in love and continue living at the coast. He's hiding his use of morphine to kill the pain. During dinner with one of the friends they made there Victor starts acting aggressively and irrationally. Victor collapses and is helped to bed. She searches the garbage and discovers his used syringes. She confronts him and he admits he wasn't finished with his chemotherapy. He explains that he wants quality in his life and she says that he's been lying to her. She calls his Father and he comes to take him home but he wants to stay for one last  party. Hilary and Victor reconnect at the party and he tells her that he is leaving with his father to go back to the hospital in the morning. After speaking with Victor's father who says Victor wants to spend one night alone before leaving, Hilary goes back to the house they rented only to find Victor packing clothes, ready to run away and not go with his father to the hospital. Hilary confronts him about running away and Victor admits that he's afraid of hoping. At this confession, Hilary finally tells Victor she loves him and they then decide to go back to the hospital where he will fight for his life with Hilary.

Under the guidance of matron Townsend , an abandoned house is turned into a hospital. Quickly, young pampered 18-year-old Joy socialite Meadows arrives  to assist the other nurses. Initially, she is teased for having no experience, and being of a privileged background. She is welcomed by head nurse Babs Whitney , who becomes the main interest of Lt. Wally O'Brien , whose friend has just recently died in the war. Joy has difficulty adjusting to the violent conditions and starts to miss her easy and innocent life on the Lower East Side in Manhattan after meeting a wounded New York soldier, Robbie Neil . She considers giving up and returning to America, but Mrs. Townsend assures her that life will get easier after she gets used to it. Matters are not improved when a French soldier forces himself up to her. Wally attempts to court Babs, but she is not vulnerable to his advances. They get acquainted, however, after Babs falls of her bicycle and Wally takes care of her minor injuries. Months pass by, and Joy, now a heroic nurse, falls in love with Robbie. She dreams of getting married and having babies, and is certain that Robbie will soon ask her. Babs is more open to letting men in her life as well, and agrees to go out with Wally. The four go to a party, along with Brooklyn-born nurse Rosalie Parker  and Wally's friend Frank Stevens . On their way in Wally's Rolls Royce, Wally and Babs are almost bombed and kiss each other in the heat of the adventure. They quickly leave the party, as it is swamped by drunk men, and return home. Wally attempts to have sex with her, but Babs rejects him and they get into a major fight over their intentions. The next morning, Wally announces to Babs that he will fly to Germany, and they part without romance. Babs, realizing that she loves Wally, is left devastated, unlike Joy, who is enlightened to finally be engaged to Robbie. Shortly after, Joy finds out that Robbie is already married. Devastated and humiliated, she arranges for herself to be transferred to another hospital. During her absence, shy nurse Kansas  is killed on the battlefield while traveling. In this period, Joy is too busy partying with married men, and living an immoral life in Paris. For this reason, Townsend decides to send her back to America. Desperate, Joy turns to Babs for help, and she is successfully reinstalled at her first hospital. There, she is shocked to find Robbie, who admits to her that he has always loved her, causing Joy to lose her mind. Simultaneously, the hospital is bombed, causing many to die.

            " The opening shot of the film introduces us to seven recent graduates of Georgetown University: Billy , Wendy , Alec , Kevin , Jules , Kirby , and Leslie . The film jumps forward to a hospital where the group awaits to learn of the status of Billy and Wendy, who were in a driving accident. Neither of them is seriously hurt, but Wendy’s car is destroyed as a result of Billy’s recklessness. Billy is arrested at the hospital under drunk driving charges. While at the hospital, Kirby sees a medical student named Dale , with whom he has been infatuated since college. Later the group gathers at their favorite college hang out, St. Elmo’s Bar. It is revealed that the cause of Billy's drunkenness was his recent firing from a job that Alec helped get him. Alec, at the studio apartment he shares with Leslie, tells her he is trying to get a better-paying job, even though it means switching political parties. He pressures Leslie to marry him, but Leslie isn't convinced that she's ready. Meanwhile, at Kevin and Kirby’s apartment, Kirby tells Kevin of his love for Dale. Billy later comes over to stay, saying he can't deal with his wife. After a shopping trip with the girls, Jules invites Kevin over to her apartment where he is incredulous at its extravagance. Jules asks Kevin why he has never made a pass at her, and accuses him of being gay and in love with Alec. Kevin visits Alec and Leslie for dinner. Alec confesses to Kevin that while buying lingerie for Leslie, he had sex with the lingerie saleswoman. Leslie then tries on the red slip Alec bought, and the two end up fooling around, leaving Kevin to cook dinner. Later Kevin, in a conversation with a prostitute, asks her why she has never tried to solicit him. She responds that she thought he was gay. Billy visits Wendy at the welfare office where she works, and joins her for dinner with her relatives. Wendy borrows money from her father , who pressures her to get married. While drunk, Billy climbs onto the roof where Wendy follows him and they discuss after-college life with Wendy revealing she is a virgin. They later kiss on the couch, but after he tries to take it further, she tells him they should not see each other anymore. During Halloween at St. Elmo’s Bar, Jules reveals to Leslie that she is having an affair with her married boss. Meanwhile, Billy, while playing saxophone, sees his wife with another man in the crowd and attacks him. Billy is fired and thrown out of the bar where he and his wife fight, then kiss. The girls have lunch at a soup kitchen where Wendy is working. Wendy and Leslie confront Jules over her affair with her boss. She tells them not to worry and leaves. Wendy and Leslie to talk about their relationships. Meanwhile, Billy, who is house-sitting for Mr. Kim, a wealthy Korean businessman, is caught by his boss with a woman, and fired. In drenching rain, Kirby follows Dale to a house party, and reveals his feelings for her. She tries to rebuff him, but fails. Billy returns to his old frat house at the college, where he ends up playing ball and asking for a job. He visits his wife and baby. She says she wants an annulment but Billy refuses, promising he will change. Kirby takes a job working for Mr. Kim. He invites Dale to a party he is secretly holding at Mr. Kim’s house. At the party, Wendy attends with a bookish-looking man named Howie , and Jules gets drunk. Alec then “announces” to the gathering that he and Leslie are engaged, upsetting her, as she had not consented. She confronts him about her suspicions of his infidelity, and Alec at first plays dumb. Enraged, he attacks Kevin, wrongly thinking Kevin had told Leslie about his misbehavior. Leslie is heartbroken, realizing she wasn't just being paranoid. Alec demands Leslie moves out of their apartment immediately. After the party, Kirby, who had been trying to find Dale, confronts Dale’s roommate, demanding to know where Dale is. Billy and Jules ride home. Jules is about to confide a secret in Billy, but all Billy wants is sex. Jules refuses, and throws him out of her car. Pursuing Dale, Kirby drives to the ski lodge where she is staying. The door is answered by a man, and Kirby, realizing it is Dale’s boyfriend, runs back to the car. He tries to drive away but the car becomes stuck in snow. Dale and her boyfriend convince him to come inside. Leslie, kicked out of her apartment, goes to Kevin’s place to stay. She discovers a box of photographs of her. Kevin confesses his love for her, and they make love. The next morning, Alec comes by, using the key Kevin had given him earlier, and apologizes. Leslie reveals her presence, wrapped only in an afghan, enraging Alec. In disbelief, he leaves. Mr. Kim arrives home, discovering his house in a mess from the party. Wendy, drunk and passed out on the staircase, tells him that he took her car. As Kirby prepares to leave Dale’s cottage, Dale tells him she is flattered by his affections. In a surprising moment, he kisses her, and she does not resist. Wendy meets her father at a café. She tells him that the car that Kirby borrowed  is fixed, but wants to return it to her father. She also tells him she does not want to marry Howie, the man her parents arranged her to date, and that she wants to move out. Leslie goes over to her apartment to pick up her possessions, and is surprised to find Alec there, not at work. They squabble over the record collection, and fight about their affairs. Alec then mutters to himself how he still wants Leslie, but she doesn't hear. In the climax of the film, Leslie asks for help and reveals that Jules has for weeks been pretending to go to work. Having been unable to make the payments, her car and furniture were repossessed. In shock, Jules has locked herself into her apartment with the windows wide open, admitting the freezing winter air. The boys come over to rescue her, climbing on to the fire escape. Kirby goes off to find Billy, who now works at a gas station. Kevin tells Alec that he was the one who got Billy the job this time. Enraged, Alec attacks Kevin again, dangling him over the edge of the fire escape, but with Leslie’s intervention, he calms down. Alec, still annoyed, doesn't seem to be concerned about Jules anymore until Leslie, for the first time in their relationship, aggressively tells him to back off. An exhausted Jules finally unlocks her door just as Billy bursts through it. Jules reveals that she is disgusted with her behavior towards her \"step-monster\" and that recently for the first time, they shared a real conversation, but then she fell into a coma and isn't expected to awake. Billy consoles and comforts her, comparing her behavior to St. Elmo's fire . She finally laughs, indicating to the others that she is all right. Wendy moves into her own place, where Billy comes to visit and states that has agreed to a divorce, pays back some of the money he owes her and announces he is moving to New York and pursue a career as a saxophonist. He asks her for a \"going away present,\" which turns out to be them making love. At the bus station, the group says goodbye to Billy. Billy whispers to Alec, \"don't let her go,\" motioning to Leslie. The opening montage of the group at graduation appears again, bringing the film full circle. Leslie announces that she needs to be alone for a while, not dating either Alec or Kevin. Alec and Kevin agree and make up as friends. Once at St. Elmo's Bar, the group decides to have brunch on Sunday, but not at St. Elmo's Bar; they instead choose Houlihan's because there's \"not so many kids\" there. This symbolizes that they are finally moving on from college life and ready to enter the real world as adults.\n",

            "Four teenage girls — Lena, Tibby, Bridget, and Carmen — are best friends from Bethesda, Maryland, who are about to separate for the summer for the first time in their lives. Lena is spending the summer in Greece with her grandparents; Tibby is staying at home; Bridget is going to soccer camp in Mexico; and Carmen is visiting her father in South Carolina. On one of their final days shopping together, the girls find a seemingly ordinary pair of jeans that fit them all perfectly and flatter their figures, despite their very different measurements. The girls dub them the Traveling Pants and decide to share them equally over the course of the summer. They part the next day, and the film focuses on each girl's journey separately. ;Lena Kaligaris Through the unexpected intervention of the Pants, Lena meets a boy named Kostos Dounas, a Greek-American like her. Lena learns from her grandparents that her family and Kostos' family are sworn enemies stemming from an old family feud. Despite this, Kostos continues to pursue Lena, and the two develop feelings for each other. Lena holds back, though, until one day when she admits to herself that she is afraid of love. Once she makes this realization, she begins a secret relationship with Kostos in earnest. On their last night together, while they are dancing, Kostos tells Lena that he loves her. Before Lena can answer, Lena's family barges in, angrily pulling Lena away. Lena later confronts her grandfather and asks to go see Kostos before he leaves, to which her grandfather agrees. Kostos and Lena share a passionate kiss, and Lena confesses her love for him. ;Tibby Rollins While on the job at a discount department store, Tibby hears a loud crashing sound, and finds a young girl who has fainted in the deodorant aisle. She frantically calls for help, and the girl is taken away in an ambulance. Later, when Lena from Greece mails the magical Pants to Tibby, they are delivered to the wrong house, and someone comes to Tibby's house to deliver them - coincidentally, Bailey Graffman, the girl who had fainted at the store. Fascinated by Tibby's movie, or \"suckumentary\", and her movie making, Bailey becomes Tibby's self-appointed assistant. Tibby is annoyed by this at first, but gradually grows to accept Bailey. She later learns from Bailey's neighbor that Bailey has leukemia. Bailey eventually goes to the hospital with a bad infection. Tibby avoids the hospital for a while, but eventually visits Bailey, bringing the Traveling Pants. She offers them to Bailey and pleads with her to take them so that they can help her. Bailey responds by saying that the pants have already worked their magic on Bailey by bringing her and Tibby together. Tibby spends a lot of time with Bailey in the hospital after that. A couple days later, Tibby receives a phone call in the morning from Mrs. Graffman, Bailey's mother, saying that Bailey died in the night. When Carmen comes back home from South Carolina, Tibby visits her to try and help her with her feelings of being snubbed by her father. Tibby later goes to Bridget's house along with Carmen in order to bring Bridget out of a period of sadness she's going through. Over the course of the movie, Tibby undergoes dramatic changes in outlook due to her time with Bailey. ;Bridget Vreeland Shortly after arriving at soccer camp in Baja California, Mexico, Bridget develops a crush on one of the coaches, Eric Richman. She reveals to Eric and the audience that a psychiatrist who evaluated her following her mother's suicide described her as \"single-minded to the point of recklessness,\" presumably as a way of avoiding dealing with her mother's death. This statement aptly describes Bridget's pursuit of Eric, despite the fact that flings between coaches and campers are forbidden. She flirts with Eric, shows off for him during games, and more. When Bridget's turn with the Traveling Pants finally comes, she puts them on that night and walks around outside Eric's cabin, leading him to the beach. It is implied in the movie  that Bridget loses her virginity to Eric. The event leaves Bridget feeling empty and listless, even once she returns home. After learning about this in a letter, Lena calls Carmen and Tibby, and they arrive at Bridget's house to cheer her up. She tells them she is worried she is like her mother, whose mood also swung easily from very up to very down, eventually resulting in deep depression and suicide. Carmen and Tibby comfort Bridget by reassuring her that she is stronger than her mother. Eric visits Bridget and apologizes for his behavior over the summer, and tells her that while she is too young for him now, he hopes she will give him a shot when she is older, giving Bridget some much-needed closure. ;Carmen Lowell During the summer Carmen goes to her dad's house in South Carolina. On arrival, she is shocked when her dad immediately introduces her to a new family that he is about to marry into; they are blonde White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, unlike Carmen who was raised by her Puerto Rican mother. During her time there her father and her new family neglect her emotionally, driving her to throw a stone through their dining room window, and catch a bus back to Maryland. At home she tells Tibby about her time with her dad and Tibby convinces her to confront her father with a phone call and finally tell him that she's mad at him. Carmen tells her father and he apologizes. Her summer ends with the four of them returning south where she is an attendant at her father's wedding, where at the reception he makes a public apology for having snubbed her.\n",

        "Η απλούστερη ιδέα για τη Vector Space αναπαράσταση μίας συλλογής κειμένων, είναι η αναπαράσταση τους με ιστόγραμμα εμφάνισης των λέξεων. (Bag of words) Σαφώς ένα απλό ιστόγραμμα (σε συνδυασμό με cosine similarity) δεν είναι πολύ καλή ιδέα για διανύσματα τα οποία δεν έχουν κανονικοποιηθεί. Πολύ πιθανό μία περιγραφή που έχει πολλές λέξεις να βγει \"όμοια\" με κάποια άλλη που έχει λίγες λέξεις, διότι έτυχε κάποιες από τις \"σημαντικές\" λέξεις της δεύτερης να βρέθηκαν έστω και μία φορά στη πρώτη. Για να κανονικοποιήσουμε τη πληροφορία μίας λέξης εντός κειμένου, χρησιμοποιούμε τη σχετική της συχνότητα (tf: term frequency), άρα μας ενδιαφέρει άμεσα το πόσο μεγάλη (σε tokens) είναι μία περιγραφή, ώστε να αποδώσουμε καλύτερα την επίδραση ενός token, δηλαδή πόσο \"μονοπωλεί\" το νόημα της περιγραφής, σε σχέση πάντα με την έκταση της. \n",
        "\n",
        "Αυτό είναι μία πρώτη ιδέα, ωστόσο ενδεχομένως να ποινικοποιεί κάποιες σπάνιες λέξεις οι οποίες όμως συνδέεουν άμεσα περιγραφές που σχετίζονται. (Ένα παράδειγμα για διαίσθηση αυτού που λέμε, είναι πχ. η λέξη \"bandit\" [ληστής]. Δεν είναι ιδιαίτερα συνηθισμένη λέξη, αλλά παραπέμπει σε ταινίες δράσης, οπότε δεν θέλουμε να χάνεται στη διανυσματική αναπαράσταση που προσπαθούμε να κατασκευάσουμε.) Γι΄αυτό, πολλαπλασιάζουμε τη tf \"επίδραση\" κάθε λέξης με την idf (inverse document frequency). Το idf είναι μέγεθος (κλιμακωμένο λογαριθμικά) που υποδηλώνει πόσο σπάνια είναι μία λέξη στο συνολικό vocabulary που συντίθεται από **όλες** τις περιγραφές που μας ενδιαφέρουν.\n",

Πάνω σε αυτή την ιδέα (και γενικότερα σε αυτό που σε NLP εφαρμογές θα λέγαμε \"short-time\" analysis, αν και εδώ δεν ασχολούμαστε με την έννοια του χρόνου) χτίζουν τα W2V embeddings.

            "The film stars Lewis H. Lapham, who plays himself as editor of Harper's Magazine. Lapham opens the film with the question of whether or not America has a \"ruling class,\" a circle of wealthy and powerful families that run the banks, businesses, and government, essentially controlling everything in America. To answer this question, Lapham devises a fictional scenario following the post-graduation paths of two young Yale graduates, themselves from opposite economic beginnings. The paths they take gradually clue them, and the audience, into the reality posed by the question. Caton Burwell plays \"Jack Bellami,\" a recent Yale graduate who comes from a rich family. Unlike his family or his friends, Jack seems unsure of what he wants to do with his life and wonders how he could make a difference in the world. Jack ultimately decides to become a banker, working at Goldman Sachs. He chooses the job after coming to the conclusion that the banking industry controls the world and that it would be easier and more effective to become a part of the system in order to change it from within. Paul Cantagallo plays \"Mike Vanzetti,\" another recent Yale graduate who is best friends with Jack Bellami. Unlike his friend, Mike is from a middle-class background, meaning he isn't wealthy like his friend Jack. Mike wants to change the world from outside the system. He decides to become a writer and goes headfirst into the character, renting a studio apartment and getting a job as a waiter. He refuses to \"sell out\" by way of writing for a major newspaper or by pandering to the masses by writing lowest-common-denominator material. Mike's story takes center stage in the second half of the film, after Jack's decision to join Goldman and his subsequent success there. A run-in with Mike leads Jack to offer him a job at the company, an offer Mike initially rejects. As his student-loan bills start piling up, however, Mike begins to resent his lack of money and low-paying job, as well as the inability of his writing to enact change. Mike's girlfriend, Taylor, invites him to a wealthy friend's party, at which she encourages him to continue his work. A short time after the party, Lapham invites Mike to take a trip to a \"space that used to be called, in another age of man, Mexico.\" This land was Texas. In Texas, Lapham shows Mike how the powerful control the government, and how money, in the end, trumps any effort by the non-wealthy to alter society. Ultimately, Mike decides to abandon his writerly dream and takes up Jack's job offer. During a visit to Taylor's mansion home, Mike plays a game of tennis with his girlfriend and they discuss his decision. Taylor is horrified with his new defeatist attitude. Mike lectures his girlfriend on his new worldview: that money is all that matters, and that, as society goes to hell, wealth is one's only defense against the routine abuses and corruption of the ruling class. The film then splits with two endings. The first shows Mike during his first day as a banker, zooming in on him at an initiation program: His panic and displeasure are evident as he immediately regrets what he has done. The second ending  has Mike sidetracked when he agrees to watch a stage show. It is being rehearsed by the lead singer of \"THE WHATS?\" and a group of children. The song they play discusses the themes of the film. The film ends with Mike in the woods, leaving the viewer in the dark on the question of whether Mike makes it to work or has his mind changed by the song.\n",

Immediately, the new President is too busy for her husband and family as she deals with a powerful opposition senator , and a Central American dictator (Eli Wallach}. Thad attempts to find something meaningful to do as the \"first lady.\" Much time is given to his chagrin at being assigned an ultra-feminine bedroom and office within the White House. It is clear that no one, especially Thad McCloud, has given any thought to how a President's husband might fit into the scheme of things. Enter Doris Reid Weaver , Thad's former flame and now an international business woman. She wants Thad back -- and offers him a lucrative position in her company as bait. Leslie has asked him to show visiting dictator Valdez around Washington, with disastrous results. To further complicate things, the first daughter is running around town with a very unsuitable boyfriend and using her position to get out of scrapes with the police. Son Peter has become a bully, using his Secret Service men for protection as he terrorizes everyone in his school -- including the principal. The only solution, in 1964 of course, is for Leslie to discover that she is pregnant, and resign the presidency in order to devote herself full-time to her family.\n",

She has many suitors, none of whom she takes seriously. One day she meets an extremely charming and handsome banker named Walter Louis Saxel, and they fall immediately into a strong attraction, which for her is real love. After a few days of closeness she is shocked when he tells her he is already engaged to someone else. Nonetheless the two of them very nearly marry one another on an impulse, but they are prevented from doing so by arbitrary external forces. After five years, they meet once again, by chance, in New York City. The banker is now married with two children  and is extremely successful in his career, but Ray and he still share the same strong attraction. Ray loves him so much that she gives up her career in dress design and becomes his kept mistress, seeing him only when it is convenient for him. Walter keeps up the appearance of a \"happy marriage\" and never considers divorcing his wife, whose father is his boss at the banking company. Ray's loyalty to Walter collapses only once, when he fails to contact her after he has been on an extended trip to Europe with his wife. Ray goes back to Ohio and agrees to marry Curt, an attractive and good-hearted man who proposed to her many times in their youth. However, Walter travels to Ohio to find her, and is able to persuade her to return with him. Once Walter's children reach adulthood they understand who Ray is, and they despise her. People in Walter's social circle also point condemning fingers at Ray, who suffers all this with patience and fortitude. In old age, dying of a stroke in his grand home, Walter's last faltering word is to Ray, on the phone. She dies not long afterwards in her apartment.\n",

Ayres financial wisdom is joined by the intelligent and computer-savvy secretary Sally Dugan who also was not properly recognized for her talents, and together they are able to become the most successful independent stock brokers in the world while helping a struggling high tech computer company stay afloat.

            " Alexander \"Alex\" Frederick Corvis  is framed for the murder of his girlfriend Lauren Randall , who was brutally stabbed 53 times. Three years later, he is executed in the electric chair. Soon after the execution, Alex is resurrected by a mystical crow and gifted with supernatural abilities, so he can clear his name and avenge Lauren's death. He peels off the burned flesh from his face, revealing his crow appearance. Alex follows the crow to the Salt Lake City police department's evidence room, where he discovers that Lauren was killed by a group of corrupt cops. Alex has a vision of one of the killers, who has a scar on his arm matching one he saw just before his execution. Alex finds the knife that was used on Lauren, and then goes to her grave. There, he meets with Lauren's sister Erin , who believes he is guilty. He tells her that he'll prove his innocence somehow, and disappears. Alex finds Tommy Leonard ([[David Stevens , the man who was paid to lie about Alex at the trial. Tommy tells Alex which cops killed Lauren &mdash; Madden , Martin Toomey , James Erlich , Stan Roberts , and Phillip Dutton . Alex spares Tommy's life. Later, Dutton pulls over two women, and tries to sexually assault the driver. Suddenly, he sees Alex sitting where the passenger was. Alex looks for the scar, and doesn't find it. Alex shoots Dutton in the head, and stabs him 53 times, killing him. Erin watches the news and sees Dutton's dead body on the screen, with the name \"Daisy\" cut into his head. This is Alex's sign to Erin, because Daisy was Lauren's nickname for Erin. Alex finds Erlich leaving an apartment in his Corvette. Alex kicks through Erlich's window and searches his arm for the scar, but doesn't find it. Alex drives the Corvette into the side of an abandoned bus, and blows it up with Erlich laying bloodied on the hood of the car. Alex inadvertently drops the list of names of the cops he's after, and Roberts and Toomey find it. Later, Alex gives Erin a piece of paper found in Erlich's car, and Erin now believes that Alex is innocent. She then finds out that her father, Nathan Randall  is in business with the corrupt cops who killed Lauren, and was thus indirectly responsible for her death. Nathan swears he did not intend for Lauren to die, but Erin nevertheless runs from him in horror. At the same time, Roberts and Madden kill Tommy and his family. Alex meets with his lawyer, Peter Walsh , and they talk about Lauren's death. Alex goes to the place where Lauren died and talks to her. Erin goes home, and finds Nathan dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Later, Walsh tells Alex that Nathan owns a company called Westwind Building, which owns D.E.R.T., a company that owns about a dozen other companies. Tommy used to make daily deliveries to the Key Club, a strip bar owned by D.E.R.T., and Walsh tells Alex that a place like that is about unreported cash; things like money from drugs. Lauren discovered what they were doing when she witnessed John, the police captain , killing a man at the Key Club. John had his men kill Lauren. Erin barges into Walsh's apartment, telling Alex that Nathan is dead. Alex goes to the Key Club. Madden and John meet Erin at Walsh's apartment, and explain to her about Nathan. Erin gets John's gun and aims it at him, but John gets his gun back. Madden kills Walsh, and John kidnaps Erin. Alex starts a big shootout at the Key Club and fatally impales Roberts with a pipe he breaks off the ceiling, kills the remaining police, then grabs Toomey and checks his arm for the scar, but doesn't find it on either of their arms. Madden shows up, and tries to kill Alex. Madden accidentally shoots a pipe, which ignites a gas leak; the explosion kills Toomey. Alex walks out of the fire and sees an arm hanging out of the rubble with the scar on it. Alex then leaves the rubble and watches a woman while having a flashback. Her jealous boyfriend hits Alex. The next day, the rubble is examined, and a burned skeleton forearm can be found — with pieces of metal scattered about. It turns out that this was all a forgery and that the real scarred arm remains at large. Alex goes back to Walsh's apartment. It's empty, but he finds a hint placed by Walsh which leads him to John. He goes to the police station and confronts John. After a few words, Alex brandishes the knife responsible for killing Lauren, preparing to kill John. However, his regeneration ability is apparently not working anymore, as he \"fulfilled his duty\" after finding the arm with the scar , and he is no match for the Captain, who stabs Alex several times with the knife, while verbally abusing him and attempting to convince Alex that Alex alone murdered his own girlfriend. Before Alex dies, he starts to believe he is the one who murdered Lauren. Madden, the Captain, and the Captain's secretary  pull Alex into John's taxidermy room, where Erin is tied up with her mouth stitched shut, wearing the locket that connects her to Alex. The crow picks the locket up and drops it next to Alex, who comes back to life again. Alex sets Erin free, and she runs out with John in pursuit. Alex kills Madden by throwing him into a glass trophy case that cuts his throat. Alex then sees Walsh's body hanging from the ceiling, his arm cut off. Alex kills John's secretary by throwing her against the wall, impaling her on a set of mounted antlers. The Captain gets Erin into a car and drives away, and Alex reaches the roof of the police building and jumps off onto the car. Alex punches through the car's glass roof, grabs John's arm, and rolls up the sleeve. Confirming his suspicion, Alex notices the scar on the Captain's left arm. Alex and Erin then take the Captain to the prison's death chamber and strap John into the same electric chair that Alex died in. John says he'll come back like Alex and vows to kill them both. Erin pulls the switch, and they leave John to suffer in the chair, burning long after he is dead. Alex and Erin walk outside, and Alex disappears in a whirlwind. Erin, who apparently came to visit the graves of both Alex and her sister, puts the necklace that bonded her and Alex on his headstone before leaving as she explains her renewed sense of mortality in a voice-over.\n",

            " Avery Ludlow ([[Brian Cox  has a dog named Red, a gift from his late wife, Mary, for his 50th birthday. One day, he is fishing at a lake with Red by his side when three boys come across his path; the brothers Danny ([[Noel Fisher  and Harold McCormack , and their friend Pete . Danny intimidates Avery with a shotgun and tells him to give them all his money. When Avery tells them that he has only 30 dollars, Danny becomes furious and kills Red. Ave visits a local gun store where the clerk is able to identify Danny based on the shotgun he used. Ave meets Danny's father Michael McCormack  and, in the family study, tells his story. Michael calls his sons into the study and, in front of Ave, asks them if they shot Red. They deny the incident, and Michael tells Ave to leave. Ave decides to file a lawsuit and talks to his lawyer, Sam Berry . Sam discourages him by saying that the case will not do any good, but Ave persists. Sam arranges a meeting between Ave and a reporter named Carrie . Carrie tells him that if they take the story to the media, it would be helpful for their cause. Ave agrees and gives a television interview to Carrie for a human interest piece. However, the story fails to get much attention, and Carrie's boss orders her on to another story. Carrie asks Ave about his family; he tells her that his eldest son was a habitual liar and was thrown out of the Navy on the basis of mental illness. One day, the son came back home and asked his mother, Mary, for money. She denied the request, and he beat his mother up. Thinking he had killed Mary, he then burnt his younger brother and Mary with kerosene. The younger brother was burnt to death, but Mary survived her wounds for 5 days in a coma before dying. Ave starts following the boys. Harold, who sees Ave watching them and becoming remorseful for their actions, approaches Ave and apologizes for what happened, but Ave says that he would like Danny to do the same. One day Danny is playing baseball with his friends and becomes frustrated after striking out, leaving the game in anger. Ave follows him and parks behind Danny's car. Danny confronts him and tries to hit Ave with his bat. Ave avoids the blow, striking Danny to the ground, and reminds him that, as Danny attacked in broad daylight and in open view of witnesses, it would be advisable to watch his temper in future, saying the beating he has given him is one that his father should have given to him instead. In response, Ave's store is burned to ashes. Ave goes to his lawyer and is disappointed to hear there is no evidence the McCormacks are responsible. Ave digs up Red and takes his corpse to the McCormacks' house, confronting the family with Red's decaying body. Michael and Danny both brandish pistols, with the father demanding Ave leave with Red's body. Ave refuses, at which Danny becomes furious, stepping forward, aiming to shoot Ave. Ave deflects Danny's arm as he fires; however, the shot hits Ave on his ear. Ave wrestles Danny's gun from him, throws him to the ground and holds him hostage. Telling Michael to lower his gun, Ave forces Danny to drive to the town Sheriff, where he intends to have Danny charged with attempted manslaughter. Michael comes after Ave in the family pick-up, ramming his truck off the road. Leaving Ave unconscious, the McCormacks return home, thinking Ave is dead. Night falls, during which Ave comes to and sees an Australian Cattle Dog who shows him Danny's discarded revolver, left in the wreckage. He takes the revolver and returns to the McCormack house, finding a shaken Harold, smoking on the porch. Asking for Red's body back, Harold leads Ave to where the dog's body was dumped. Michael, Danny, and Pete follow and find both of them. Both Michael and Danny are armed; Harold tells them to stand down, but Danny shoots Ave in the belly with the shotgun. Ave returns fire, shooting at Danny and Michael, wounding them. As they fall, father and son fire shots and in the crossfire, both Harold and Pete are fatally shot. Ave approaches the injured Danny and Michael, telling the father that either he or his son is responsible for Harold's death. As he heals from his wounds, Ave reads a newspaper in which his story has been published by Carrie. Carrie comes to meet him and gives him a new dog. Ave initially declines to accept it, also reminding her that two boys got killed because he wanted revenge, she leaves him alone with the new dog. Despite his protests, Ave soon becomes content with his new dog.\n",

Infuriated, El Jefe offers a $1 million reward to whoever will \"bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia\". The search progresses for two months. In Mexico City, two of El Jefe's personal henchmen, a pair of business-suit clad dispassionate hitmen, Sappensly  and Quill , enter a saloon and encounter Bennie , a retired United States Army officer who makes a meager living as a piano player and bar manager. The two men ask about Garcia, believing that they will have more luck getting answers out of a fellow American. Bennie plays dumb, saying that the name is familiar but that he doesn't know who Garcia is. It turns out that everyone in the bar knows who Garcia is; they simply don't know where he is. Bennie goes to meet his girlfriend, Elita , a prostitute at a bordello. Elita admits to having cheated on Bennie with Garcia, who had professed his love for her, something Bennie refuses to do. Elita informs him that Garcia died in a drunk driving accident the previous week. Bennie is excited by the possibility of making money by simply digging up the body. He goes to Sappensly and Quill, in the hotel room of their boss, Max, and makes a deal for US$10,000 for Garcia's head, plus two hundred dollars in advance for expenses. Bennie convinces Elita to go on a road trip with him to visit Garcia's grave, claiming that he only wants proof that Garcia is in fact dead and no longer a threat to their relationship. En route, Bennie proposes, promising that their future will soon change, and she can retire from prostitution. Elita is cautious, and warns Bennie against trying to upset their status quo. On the road, Bennie and Elita are accosted by two bikers , who pull guns and decide to rape Elita. Bennie seems unsure how to react. Elita agrees to have sex with the bikers if they spare Bennie's life, and goes off with the biker played by Kristofferson. He rips off her shirt to look at her breasts, lets her slap him twice, slaps her back, then walks away: she follows. Bennie knocks the first biker unconscious while he's playing Elita's guitar. He takes the gun and seeks the other biker and Elita. She is now passionately kissing the biker, and ready to make love with him. Bennie finds them together; then shoots him dead, as well as the first biker. The murder cycle has opened. He confesses to Elita his plan to decapitate Garcia's corpse and sell it for money. Elita is disgusted, and, still shaken from what has just happened, begs Bennie to give up this quest and return to Mexico City, where they can be married and live a modest life of relative peace. Bennie again refuses, but agrees to marry Elita in the church of the town where Garcia is buried. They find Garcia's grave, but when he opens the coffin, Bennie is struck from behind with his shovel by an unseen assailant. He wakes up to find himself half-buried in the grave with Elita, who is dead. The corpse of Garcia has been decapitated. Bennie learns from villagers that his assailants are driving a station wagon. He catches up with the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, searches their car and claims Garcia's head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie begins addressing the head as if Garcia were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita's death and then conceding that both of them probably loved her equally. Bennie is ambushed by members of Garcia's family. They re-claim the head and are about to kill Bennie when they are interrupted by the arrival of Sappensly and Quill. The hitmen pretend to ask for directions. Quill produces a sub-machine gun and murders most of Garcia's family, but is fatally shot by one of them. As Sappensly sorrowfully looks at Quill's corpse, Bennie asks: \"Do I still get paid?\" Sappensly turns to shoot but Bennie kills him, takes Garcia's head, and returns to Mexico City, \"arguing\" with Garcia's head all the while. At his apartment, Bennie gives Garcia's head a shower and then brings the head to Max's hotel room, feigning willingness to surrender the head for his $10,000, but then revealing that he is no longer motivated by money; rather, he blames Elita's death on the bounty and intends to kill everyone involved. Several men pull guns but Bennie manages to evade fire and kill them all. He takes a business card from the desk with El Jefe's address on it. El Jefe greets him as a hero and gives him a briefcase containing the promised million-dollar bounty. Bennie calmly relates how many people died for Garcia's head, including his beloved. El Jefe responds apathetically, telling Bennie to take his money and throw Garcia's head to the pigs on the way out. Infuriated that the object responsible for Elita's death is viewed as nothing more than garbage, Bennie first wounds El Jefe and then guns down all of his bodyguards. Teresa enters with her newborn son as Bennie points a gun at El Jefe's head, but hesitates to shoot. She tersely urges Bennie to kill her father, and Bennie obliges, taking along the head as he leaves the scene with the words: \"I'll look after the father, and you look after the son.\" Bennie makes a mad dash to escape, but is gunned down at the gates to El Jefe's estate.\n",

            "One day after the events of Friday the 13th Part III, police and paramedics are busy cleaning up the mess that deformed mass murderer Jason Voorhees has left at Higgins Haven, including himself. Once delivered to the Wessex County Hospital morgue, it turns out that Jason is still alive. He rises, kills the morgue doctor, Axel, by sawing his neck with a bone saw, and then a nurse, Morgan, with a stab to the stomach, and heads back to Crystal Lake. A group of friends Paul, Sam, Sara, Doug, Ted, and Jimmy, have rented a house on Crystal Lake. On the way there, the group passes Mrs. Voorhees' tombstone and a female hitchhiker. After the group drives off the hitchhiker becomes Jason's next victim, stabbed in the throat while eating a banana. Next to the rental house is the Jarvis home. The group meets Trish and Tommy when they arrive. The next day, the group befriends twins Tina and Terri, who live in the area, and they all go skinny dipping at Crystal Point. Trish and Tommy, driving by, stop to see who is at Crystal Point and the group invites Trish to a party that night. Trish's car breaks down a bit further along the road, and they are helped by Rob, a hiker with mysterious reasons for visiting Crystal Lake, who soon becomes good friends with Trish and Tommy. Next door, the kids are enjoying themselves by dancing and listening to music. With four girls and four boys, each now has a date. However conflict ensues as some of the kids switch dates. These conflicts prove to be the least of their troubles as Jason predictably stalks and kills them one by one. Sam goes out skinny dipping and is impaled from under a raft. When Paul goes out to be with her, he is stabbed in the groin. Terri decides to leave early, and is about to get on her bike, but a spear gets rammed into her back. After sleeping with Tina, Jimmy decides to celebrate with a bottle of wine. While searching for a corkscrew, Jason emerges and impales the corkscrew into Jimmy's hand and then drives a meat cleaver into his face. Upstairs, Tina, looks out the window and is grabbed and thrown two stories down, landing on the car. While a stoned Ted watches vintage stag films, he gets too close to the projector screen and is stabbed in the head with a kitchen knife though the screen from the other side. After Doug and Sara finish making love in the shower, Jason attacks Doug, crushing his head against a shower tile. He then kills Sara by driving an ax through the front door when she tries to escape. At the Jarvis house, Trish and Tommy find their mother missing, so Trish goes to Rob for help. Rob explains that he's seeking revenge for the death of his sister, Sandy Dier . Trish and Rob take Gordon, the Jarvis family dog, next door to see what's going on. Tommy is left at home, and finds Rob's newspaper articles about Jason. At the house, a frightened Gordon jumps through a second story window. Jason kills Rob in the basement, and Trish flees back to her home intending to warn Tommy. After a long chase in and between the houses, Tommy shaves his head and makes himself up to look like Jason, which is effective in distracting Jason long enough for Trish to be able to attack him with his machete. She drops the machete as Tommy picks it up and swings it at Jason's head. Jason then falls to the floor, causing the machete to cut further into his head. As he embraces his sister, Tommy sees Jason's fingers begin to move, loses control and begins hacking Jason repeatedly with the machete, while Trish screams his name. The final scene of the film has Tommy visiting Trish in the hospital, and as they embrace and hope their nightmare is over, with a bizarre shot of Tommy psychotically looking towards the camera, kind of like the thousand yard stare.  An alternate ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother floating in a tub full of bloody water. Trish lifts her mother out of the tub, prompting Mrs. Jarvis' eyes to open, revealing them to be solid white and devoid of irses. Jason suddenly appears from behind the bathroom door and prepares to attack Trish. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.\n",

His father was strong, his mother liked to bake. He was also harassed by a boy named Evert, while at the same time being in love with Evert's cute sister. At his confirmation, Evert tackled him so that all the girls' dresses were ruined by the sacramental wine. This made Evert's sister laugh at him, and with his heart broken he decided to run away to Stockholm.

            "Little Marines is an action/adventure/comedy film set in Little Rock, Arkansas. The film portrays a journey embarked upon by three boys across the woodlands near their home town to spend a summer vacation together camping in the wilderness. The film lacks the “traditional plot” of other films and focuses more on the life of the three boys in general. The film opens on the last day of school in Bryant, Arkansas. The audience is introduced to the three main characters leaving school and heading home to enjoy their summer vacation. They later meet up at Stevie's house and discuss the camping trip they've been planning on taking. The next morning Chris, Noah, & Stevie head out on bike to a remote campsite. Once there they construct a teepee, gather fire wood, swim, tell stories, reminisce, build a zip-line, and have a semi-dangerous encounter with a hooligan named \"Snake\" who temporarily terrorizes the three boys with a paintball gun.\n",

            "The village of Vileness Flats is constantly under attack by the Atomic Shopping Carts, armoured carts with large drills on their front. A bridge keeps the Carts away, but the villagers enlist the Siamese twin tag-team wrestlers, Arf and Omega, to protect them. Arf and Omega fight off the Carts and a banquet is held in their honour, where the mayor thanks them, and Steve  gives a lengthy, boring speech. The twins heckle and throw their food at Steve, and he walks away, dejected. The defeat of the Atomic Shopping Carts leads to another problem for Vileness Flats - The Bell Boys, a gang of midgets who live in the desert on the other side of the bridge. They disguise themselves as meat in order to cross the now-safe bridge, to steal the real meat from the village. These raids are depriving the villagers of necessary protein. Steve has his own problems, as well. No one but his mother knows that he is actually two people - Steve, the religious leader of Vileness Flats, and Lonesome Jack, the leader of the Bell Boys and the mastermind of the meat raids. To complicate matters further, both Steve and Jack are deeply in love with the immortal Indian princess Weescoosa, who has spent eternity searching for her one true love. Sadly, whenever it looks like she has found him, he dies. The raids are causing unrest in the village and fights are breaking out, due to lack of food. The villagers ask Arf and Omega to deal with the Bell Boys, and they agree. Before they do anything, however, they head off to a local nightclub to relax. The first act is a performance of the song \"Eloise\" , and the second is a performance by the seductive singer Peggy Honeydew. Honeydew flirts with both twins, causing them to become jealous of each other. Honeydew is part of a plan to dispatch the twins so that Lonesome Jack and the Bell Boys will be safe to attack the village. Arf and Omega become so enraged with each other that they become engaged in a knife fight, eventually killing each other. Steve, confused and worried about the whole mess, decides to jump into a local volcano to kill himself and thus get rid of the problems facing Vileness Flats. This was about as far as the film got before production was ended.\n",

            "Vertov starts by showing us, with intertitles in giant Cyrillic characters, what he sees  about the capitalist West with its foxtrot and nigger minstrels, and then switches his attention to the audience  and then the individual viewer . In one self-reflexive moment, Vertov even shows cinema-goers watching an earlier piece of the film . He takes us on a tour of the vital importance of agricultural production, which generates export revenue  so that Russia can buy machines to build more machines . This gives him the pretext to take us on a Cook’s tour of the extremities of the Soviet Union: we see the icebreaker Lenin  delivering new dogs to the Samoyeds on Novaya Zemlya, and their being invited on board to listen to a gramophone recording of the great man himself. We go to Bukhara where one of the mosques is looking very dingy and crumbled, and to Leningrad where the trams run down the middle of broad empty boulevard as a horse-drawn carriage turns out. We see a Kirghiz with a giant eagle perched on his arm, a bear encircled by yapping dogs, a fox caught in a trap and another one that is a child’s pet, guillemots, gulls, a man shooting a sable in the top of a pine tree, a pine marten, sheep being dragged into the sea for a wash and other sheep being obliged to jump in to a stream for the same purpose - the intertitles are surreal: (“You – whether you are washing your sheep in the sea  or whether you are washing your sheep in the river …”, We see trappers bringing their furs to the Госторг  trading post in exchange for manufactured goods, everyone contributing to the national economy. Ironically, the furs are destined for the Leipzig fair . In an amazing stop-frame sequence, rows of oranges align themselves in a packing box, wadges of packing material shuffle along and jump on top of them, and then the lids close . We see coke being quenched also, as well as electricity pylons and insulators, and the village electricity co-op. We see sturgeon being hoiked out of tanks to make caviar. We see barrels of butter – 'it is yours!' We see wheat being threshed, linen being spun and cotton being ginned. We see the country being modernised, although there are still some people who trust in Mohammed  or Christ  or Buddha  and we are shown a Siberian shaman looking remarkably like a North American Indian, and even a reindeer being slaughtered  as a sacrifice. We see crowds of women in full-face veils, but also a modernising country as a woman lifts her veil. And we see some tundra-dwellers eating raw reindeer meat. It’s a fantastic travelogue and anthropological document. Lenin’s mausoleum is his alone at this time . The moral: everyone produces and is building socialism. It starts with slavery and ends with developing countries joining the socialist revolution.\n",

In response, he takes them to jail. After they enter the police station, they see a little girl, dead, on the floor and Entragian shoots and kills Peter. Mary is thrown in a jail cell along with a young boy, David Carver, his parents, Ralph and Ellen, and an old man, Tom Billingsley. It's also learned the little girl is the Carver's daughter named Pie. In jail, David is praying to God and he's been doing it because of his best friend, Brian. David and Brian were riding bikes just as a crazy drunk guy in a car was coming towards them. David saves himself while the car hits Brian's bike making him fly. The car crashes and injures the man while Brian flies and smashes his face on a nearby house, causing David to pray for him, which works. The doctor at the hospital where Brian had to go called it a \"miraculous recovery\". Meanwhile, Steve Ames is in his truck following famous author Johnny Marinville who is 50 miles up ahead. Steve soon picks up a young female hitchhiker named Cynthia Smith. Johnny stops in the desert to urinate just as Entragian shows up behind him and puts the same weed he got from Peter and Mary under Johnny's motorcycle seat and \"arrests\" him. Later, David realizes Entragian's skin is breaking out and he keeps saying \"Tak\" because he is possessed. Entragian then takes Ellen so he can shift his spirit into her body and puts a vicious dog in charge of things. Pie's ghost appears and gives David a bar of soap. He proceeds to scrub his body with the soap and while the dog is distracted, David slips through the bars of the jail cell and gets out of the room. David searches the police station and finds a gun on the corpse of another sheriff. He returns to shoot the guarding dog to free everyone. Meanwhile, Steve drives up to where Johnny was captured by Entragian to find Johnny's motorcycle hidden behind dry bushes. Cynthia and Steve later search the town of Desperation, where they find all the residents dead. That night, they both meet up with the gang. They gather at a theater and Tom tells a story that took place 120 years ago, when Chinese workers digging in a mine discovered an evil spirit named \"Tak.\" The now possessed Ellen sends in a mountain lion and Tom is killed. Mary is captured by Ellen so that she can have a new body. David sees the ghost of Pie in the theater again and she leads him to the movie editing machine revealing the truth of how Tak came to the town. Mary wakes up to find herself trapped in a shed waiting to be the next host for Tak. With the help of Pie, she manages to escape, while seriously injuring Ellen's body forcing Tak to take over the body of a raven. Johnny later confesses 40 years ago in Vietnam he saw a guy, possessed by Tak, blow up the bathroom of a bar killing 87 people. The group decides to return to the cave with some explosives they found to put an end to Tak. At the entrance, a vulture comes out and kills Ralph. In order to redeem himself, Johnny goes into the mine and falls in a hole leading to a small hole where Tak is. Johnny ignites the explosives, blowing up the mine while the rest of survivors drive away in Steve's truck. Along the route driving away from the town, they pass by the RV vehicle owned by David's family and Peter's sister's car. Mary tells Steve to stop the truck to retrieve an overnight package from the car. In the back seat Mary finds an album belonging to Pie, which Steve identifies as being signed by Johnny.\n",

Here he meets a village belle named Radha . Besides his work, Kishen starts teaching English to Radha and some other people in village. Kishen and Radha slowly fall in love with each other. Unknown to Kishen, somebody is stalking him and reading his mails. Kishen leaves the village  and promises to come back. On reaching home, Kishen is surprised to see a mourning at his home. He is even more confused to see people looking astonishingly at him. But, he gets a shock of his life when he sees the portrait of his mother, signifying that his mother is dead. The real sucker punch comes when he sees his duplicate mourning next to his mother's portrait. When he tells that he is Kishen, his duplicate claims the same. When he prods the duplicate to tell something about real Kishen, the duplicate astonishes him by telling him about his life as well as about Radha. Kishen is unable to think as to how the duplicate could know about Radha, but he knows that his pet dog will identify the real master. When the dog, too, goes to the duplicate, Kishen is thrown out of his own home. Meanwhile Kishen learns about sudden death of one of his old servants, and he smells foul play. He somehow succeeds to infiltrate into his own office, which is now run by his duplicate. But, he gets arrested. Another servant tells Kishen about his mother's accident, which probably killed her.

Meanwhile, Kishen discovers the depth of the trio's planning. He finds that his dog could not identify him as it was not his dog. Like Kishen, his dog, too, had been replaced.

Was it that Raja wants Kishan out of the way so he can be near Radha, or is there another reason?\n",

            "Peter Piper, a photographer, visits a laboratory where a spider plant with teeth has been created. Piper attempts to take a picture, but is bitten on the bottom by a plant coming down from the ceiling. Piper leaves the lab via a back door, sits in a dark alley, sweating, and begins to turn green. His molecular structure is shown to be changing with the text \"This means something very nasty is happening\". When he wakes up, he finds that when he stretches, plants shoot from his arms. He is also able to climb walls. Suddenly a sweeper, who is also crawling on the wall and cleaning the walls appears there. Piper is then shown sitting on a roof, when he sees that Jane-Mary is getting mugged. He goes to save her, but he realizes that he needs a costume. He appears in the alley in an Indian costume, a fairy costume and eventually in his Spider-Plant suit. He saves Jane-Mary, who falls in love with him. He suggests to her that he might be Peter Piper, only to be told that Piper is a loser. Spider-Plant Man is then shown landing in an alley where another man says he is his enemy. Peter guesses that he is The Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, the Itchy Skull, or The Human Man, but it appears to be Batman. Batman tells him that no one cares about him anymore and that everyone only wants spiders nowadays. He no longer has the Batmobile, owning only a dilapidated \"Bat-Clio\". Even Robin has abandoned him. \"Apparently he was only in it for the money.\" He tells Piper that he has kidnapped Jane-Mary and Piper guesses that she is on Tower Bridge. Spider-Plant Man swings through London, wondering where Tower Bridge is, while Batman, who couldn't get his Bat-Clio to start, takes the Underground to Tower Bridge. Jane Mary is bound to a flag on Tower Bridge by Batman. Spider-Plant Man and Batman begin to fight, where they are mistaken by a reporter for Fathers 4 Justice activists. Peter fires a spider plant at him, followed by Batman throwing his boomerang and the battle goes on. Batman's sidekick Robin  arrives, and makes a deal with Batman for 20% of the profits on Batman products and a Robinmobile and starts attacking Piper. Whilst hanging from Tower Bridge, Spider-Plant Man makes a deal with Robin for 25% on all pajama sales and his own cereal brand with real marshmallows, Robin switches sides and attacks Batman. Batman is punched off the tower and lands on the reporter. He hijacks a scooter and gets away. Spider-Plant Man and Jane-Mary start to kiss. Robin tells Peter it's time to go and moments later Peter punches him. He then asks Jane-Mary whether she will marry him, and she responds, \"Who's asking me, Spider-Plant Man or the man behind the spandex?\" He replies, \"You choose\". Jane-Mary is then shown lying in the sun on a beach, next to Piper who is still in his Spider-Plant suit.\n",

Crushed, Muggs has no choice but to return home; Glimpy tags along with his pal. Once the duo arrive back to the East Side, they are quick to learn that Danny  has been thrown in jail. Danny's arrest resulted in missing medical alcohol from the warehouse he works at. Muggs and Glimpy obviously believe that Danny is innocent, but they have to find out who really stole the missing items. The duo are suspicious about a new kid in their club, Spider O'Brien. As it turns out, Spider works with Danny at the warehouse, and was invited into the club by Danny. Wanting information from Spider, Muggs pretends to be his friend. Spider fesses up to Muggs, and tells him all about a trap door he has to leave open at night for the gangsters who really stole the items. Muggs also learns that Spider only took this job with the gangsters in order to pay for his ailing mother's medical operation. Sadly, Spider is killed by 'Fingers' Belmont and another gangster, both of whom Spider works with. They feel that Spider ratted them out. As it turns out, 'Fingers' was once a former member of Muggs' gang. Always skeptical about 'Fingers', Muggs feels that he may have been the one who has really been stealing from the warehouse. Muggs asks permission from the police to try and put a stop to the gangsters' actions, and get Danny off the hook. Meanwhile, Muggs' sister has been working as at the bar owned by the gangsters' leader, named Larry. Larry has taken a liking to Muggs' sister, which could mean trouble for her.\n",

            " The story starts as one of the robots flies into a scientist's secret lair and unloads a pile of cash into a vault. The robot is controlled completely from the scientists command center, and we see that he is one of many robots similar to him, lined up along the walls of the lair. Next, we see the front page of the Daily Planet, reporting the \"mechanical monsters\" robbery right alongside an announcement for the display of 50&nbsp;million dollars of the world's rarest gems at the local museum.  Later, as Lois and Clark are covering the museum's exhibit for the Planet, a robot lands in the street outside. The police pelt it with machine gun fire as it marches towards the museum, but the bullets bounce harmlessly off. Museum visitors, including Clark and Lois, flee as the monster marches towards the jewels and begins loading them into an opening in its back. While Clark phones the Planet from the nearest phone booth, Lois climbs into the monster's back, just as the monster leaves the museum and takes off into the sky. Clark emerges from the booth, notices Lois gone, and says, \"This is a job for Superman!\" He goes back into the phone booth and changes his clothes, emerging in his classic red-and-blue costume. Flying high above the city, Superman spots the robot and uses his X-ray vision to see Lois inside with the jewels.  He lands on it and struggles to open the door in its back, only to have the scientist maneuver the robot upside down and throw him off into a power line, tangling him in the wires. As the robot is upside down, the door flies open and all the jewels fall out, with Lois surviving only by hanging for dear life until the robot flips back over. As Superman struggles to free himself from the wires, the robot arrives at the lair, but instead of jewels, the scientist finds Lois in its payload. Infuriated, he demands that she tell him where the jewels are. The next time we see her, she is bound and gagged on a platform held over a pot of boiling metal in part of what appears to be an industrial foundry. The scientist pulls a lever which starts some machinery gradually lowering her closer and closer to the liquid. Meanwhile, Superman frees himself from the power lines and knocks down the door to the scientist's lair, only to meet the army of robots . Under the scientist's control, the robots emit fire from nozzles positioned on the lower part of their heads, encircle Superman, and pound him with their fists. Initially, the robots seem to have the upper hand, beating Superman to the ground, but Superman defeats them, sending the scientist running. When Superman catches up with him, he is holding a knife to the rope holding Lois' platform above the molten metal, and threatens to cut it if he takes another step. Superman makes a move, the rope is cut, and Superman speeds across the room to catch Lois just in time, landing on a ledge below the pot of molten metal and the scientist. The scientist then pulls a lever to dump the hot liquid on them, but Superman shields Lois with his cape, then grabs the scientist and flies from the lair to take him and Lois back to the city. The film ends with a shot of the next issue of the Planet, describing the latest adventure -- Superman stopped the mechanical monsters, the scientist was arrested and the jewels are recovered. In the office, Clark says \"That's a wonderful story, Lois.\" She replies, \"Thanks Clark, but I owe it all to Superman.\" Clark smiles.\n",

            " Carey's performance was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.<ref name72}} The show featured a number of musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. It was directed by Larry Jordan, who had previously worked with Carey on the music video for \"Someday\". The show began with the song \"Emotions\" ; Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan.{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p\"nickson4\"/> They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said \"this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King\", beginning the performance shortly after.{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p\"nickson5\"/> She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note.{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p\"nickson6\"/> Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, \"Make It Happen\" , Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals:  \"The roughness of this version succeeded in a way the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished.\"{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p\"nickson7\"/> Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective.\n",

The film shows a young Dylan: confident if not arrogant, confrontational and contrary, but also charismatic and charming. Notable scenes include: *Dylan's extended taunting of Time Magazines London arts and science correspondent Horace Freeland Judson who was subjected to what he believes to be a contrived tirade of abuse from Dylan. *Dylan's interrupting Alan Price's backstage performance of \"Little Things\" to ask Price why he left The Animals. *Dylan and Baez singing Hank Williams songs in a hotel room, as well as Baez singing the first few verses of \"Percy's Song\" and \"Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word\"  *Dylan's pre-concert philosophical jousting with a \"science student\" ([[Terry Ellis . *Grossman negotiating with former Bebop Dance band leader and music agent, Tito Burns. *Dylan singing \"Only a Pawn in Their Game\" on July 6, 1963 at a Voters' Registration Rally in Greenwood, Mississippi .Dylan: Don't look back *A selection of songs from Dylan's Royal Albert Hall performance. *Dylan regaling the room with \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" after proclaiming \"Hey, that's pretty GOOD, man!\" in the middle of Donovan's performance of \"To Sing for You\". Dylan's romance with Baez had pretty much run its course by the time of the tour, and the film candidly captures what amounts to their breakup. The opening scene of the film also served as a kind of music video for Dylan's song \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", in which the singer displays and discards a series of cue cards bearing selected words and phrases from the lyrics . Allen Ginsberg makes a cameo appearance during this episode.\n",

            "Dewey Cox begins his quest for stardom in Springberry, Alabama in 1946. While playing with his brother Nate, Dewey accidentally cuts his brother in half at the waist with a machete. This leads Dewey's father  to frequently repeat the phrase \"The wrong kid died\" throughout the film. The trauma causes Dewey to lose his sense of smell&nbsp;&ndash; \"you've gone smell blind,\" states Dewey's mother. After his brother's death is announced by a physician making a housecall, Dewey's mother  sends him to the local store to buy some butter and a candle. There, he meets a blues guitarist , who lets Dewey play his guitar. Dewey is a natural. After a successful, yet oddly controversial, talent show performance, then fourteen-year-old Dewey  decides to leave Springberry with his newly-identified 12-year-old girlfriend, Edith . They soon marry and have a baby; Edith begins to criticize Dewey and insist that his dream of being a musician will never happen. While working at an all-African American nightclub, Dewey gets a break when he replaces singer Bobby Shad ([[Craig Robinson  at the last minute, much to the delight of the Hasidic Jewish record executives attending the show. Dewey then is brought to the studio where he is interrupted while recording a rockabilly rendition of \"That's Amore\". The recording executive  berates Dewey as talentless. Backed into a corner, Dewey makes the first recording of \"Walk Hard\", the song inspired by a speech Dewey gave to Edith. Within 35 minutes, the song becomes a hit, and Dewey begins to get caught up in the fame of rock and roll. When Dewey stumbles upon a room of groupies smoking with drummer Sam , Sam introduces Dewey to marijuana. Sam tells Dewey to leave because he \"don't want no part of this shit\"  but Dewey eventually tries it and continues to do so every time he finds Sam with a new drug. His attitude and drug problems cause him to become unfaithful to Edith. Dewey's father then returns to inform Dewey that Dewey's mother has died. Pa manages to make Dewey feel responsible for her death, contributing to an already high level of inner turmoil. Dewey is then introduced to cocaine, which leads to a change in his music to a louder, \"punk\" type. With the addition of backup singer Darlene Madison , Dewey produces several more hit records. However, they become attracted to each other, and Dewey weds Darlene while still married to Edith, which leads to both women leaving him. Dewey is eventually busted after purchasing drugs from an undercover cop, serves time in jail, and spends time in rehab before Darlene returns. They then move to Berkeley, California, in 1966 at the beginning of the '60s counterculture movement. Dewey writes protest songs for dwarfs. His singing style is then compared by a reporter to that of Bob Dylan, which Dewey angrily denies. In the next scene, a music video shows that Dewey's new song mimics Dylan's style, including opaque lyrics . During a visit with his band to India, Dewey takes LSD with The Beatles , which causes Dewey to lose touch with reality yet again and have a Yellow Submarine-esque hallucination. Dewey becomes obsessed with every aspect of the recording process and is consumed with creating his masterpiece entitled Black Sheep (an homage to Brian Wilson's [[Smile . The band does not appreciate his insane style of music and his continuous abuse of the others in the group. As a result the band breaks up; Darlene is also unable to deal with Dewey's insanity and drug problems and leaves him. Dewey goes through another stay in rehab, where he is visited by Nate's ghost . Nate ridicules Dewey's self-pity and tells him to start writing songs again. Dewey is next seen jogging into the 1970s, and hosting a CBS variety television show. But his song-block prevents him from writing a masterpiece for his brother. . Nate appears again and tells Dewey that he needs to tell Pa that he loves him. Although Dewey's father appreciates his courage, he challenges Dewey to a fight to the death with machetes. However, Pa accidentally cuts himself in half. Just before he dies, the senior Cox forgives Dewey, and tells him to be a better father than he was. His death causes Dewey to have an emotional breakdown and he destroys almost everything in his home. Dewey accepts that it is time to focus on spending time with his numerous children. Darlene returns to him in 1992. Dewey talks to Darlene about what he has done since they last met. After finally understanding what is most important to him, Dewey regains his sense of smell. In 2007, Dewey becomes popular with younger listeners through rapper Lil' Nutzzak's sampling of \"Walk Hard\". Dewey is upset about this at first, but pays it little mind when he is informed that he is to receive the lifetime achievement award. Dewey is reluctant to play a song at first, fearing the temptations he once succumbed to, but his wife, children and grandchildren put their full support behind him. Dewey reunites with his band, and he is finally able to fulfill his dream of creating one great masterpiece that sums up his entire life with his final song, \"Beautiful Ride.\" Dewey dies 3 minutes after the performance.\n",

            "Cinderella is the much-loved only child of a widowed aristocrat. After deciding that his beloved daughter needs a mother's care, Cinderella's father marries Lady Tremaine, a proud woman with two daughters from her first marriage, Drizella and Anastasia. Plain and socially awkward, these stepsisters are bitterly envious of the beautiful and charming Cinderella. After the death of Cinderella's father, Lady Tremaine and her daughters take over the estate, and begin to abuse and mistreat Cinderella out of jealousy, and even allow their cat, Lucifer, to torment her. Despite being forced into servitude in her own home, Cinderella becomes a kind woman and befriends the animals living in the barn and many of the mice and birds who live in and around the chateau. At the royal palace, the King is distressed that his son does not intend to marry. Determined to see grandchildren, the King and the Duke organize a ball for Prince Charming in an effort to enable his son to marry, with every eligible maiden in the kingdom requested to attend. When the invitation to the ball arrives, Cinderella asks her stepmother if she can attend, since she too is an eligible maiden. Lady Tremaine agrees, provided Cinderella finishes her chores and finds something suitable to wear. Her animal friends, led by Jaq and Gus, fix a gown that belonged to Cinderella's mother, using beads and a sash cast away by Drizella and Anastasia. When Cinderella wears her dress just before departing, Lady Tremaine compliments Cinderella's gown, subtly pointing out the beads and sash. Angered by the apparent theft of the discarded items, the stepsisters destroy the gown, forcing Cinderella to remain behind while her stepfamily leaves for the royal ball. At the point of giving up her dreams, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears and bestows upon Cinderella a silver blue dress with glass slippers, and transforms a pumpkin and various animals into a carriage with horses, a coachman and a footman. Cinderella departs for the ball after the godmother warns her that the spell will break at the stroke of midnight, meaning that her dress and everything else will change back to the way they were. At the ball, the Prince rejects every girl , until he sees Cinderella. The two fall in love and dance alone throughout the castle grounds until the clock starts to chime midnight. Cinderella flees to her coach and away from the castle, inadvertently dropping one of her glass slippers. After the Duke tells the King of the disaster, they plan to find Cinderella with the slipper they recovered during her exit. The next morning, the King proclaims that the Grand Duke will visit every house in the kingdom to find the girl who fits the glass slipper, so that she can be married to the Prince. When this news reaches Cinderella's household, her stepmother and stepsisters prepare for the Grand Duke's arrival. Cinderella, overhearing the news, begins dreamily humming the song from the palace ball the previous night. Upon realizing that Cinderella is the girl who danced with the Prince, Lady Tremaine locks Cinderella up to her attic bedroom. When the Grand Duke arrives, the mice steal the key to Cinderella's room, but before they can deliver it they are ambushed by Lucifer. The animals alert Bruno, Cinderella's bloodhound, who scares Lucifer out of the house. As the Duke prepares to leave after the stepsisters unsuccessfully try on the slipper, Cinderella appears and requests to try it on. Knowing that the slipper will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman, causing him to drop the slipper, which shatters into hundreds of pieces. The Duke laments over the broken slipper, but Cinderella then produces the other glass slipper, much to her stepmother's horror. Delighted at this indisputable proof of the maiden's identity, the Duke slides the slipper onto her foot, which fits perfectly. Soon after, Cinderella and the Prince celebrate their wedding, surrounded by confetti tossed by the King, the Grand Duke and the mice.\n",

The Stepmother and Stepsisters demand that Cinderella sew all three of them elegant gowns for the ball from the fabric of their old dresses. Cinderella has no idea what to do.

            "In the late eighteenth century, the Grande Dame of France, an elderly aristocrat, summons The Brothers Grimm to tell them the real story of the little cinder girl. She shows them a portrait of a young woman, named Danielle de Barbarac, and a glass slipper, and begins her tale. Danielle, a little girl at age eight, lives with her widowed father, Auguste, who shares with her a love of books and progressive ideas. He brings home a new wife, the haughty Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, who has two daughters about Danielle's age, Marguérite and Jacqueline. He has a heart attack soon after, and with his dying breath professes his love for Danielle rather than Rodmilla, who envies Danielle and treats her like a servant thereafter. Marguérite is as cruel as Rodmilla, but Jacqueline is kind and gentle. Ten years later, in the manor's orchard, Danielle catches a man stealing her father's horse. She unseats him with a well-aimed apple, but is horrified to learn that he is Henry, the Crown Prince of France, trying to escape the responsibilities of court. He buys her silence with a purse of gold, which she decides she will use to rescue an elderly servant sold to the Crown to pay the household's debts. She dresses as a noblewoman and goes to court to ransom the servant, where she encounters the Prince again. After the jailor refuses to release the servant, she argues against the injustice and quotes Thomas More's Utopia. Henry is so captivated that he orders the man released and begs for her name, but she evades his pleas and leaves him instead with her mother's name, the Comtesse Nicole de Lancret. When Henry returns the horse to the manor, it's plain that Rodmilla intends to match her daughter Marguérite with the Prince, despite the marriage his parents have arranged with the Spanish royals. The King strikes a bargain with the recalcitrant Prince, telling Henry to choose his own bride before they give a ball in honour of Leonardo da Vinci, who has come to court, or he will choose for him. Henry meets Danielle again by the river, where he is arguing with Da Vinci about love and fate, but again she runs away. While looking for Da Vinci soon after Henry finds Danielle's childhood friend, Gustave, who knows the whole story, and tells him Nicole de Lancret is staying with Rodmilla. When he arrives at the manor, Danielle agrees to accompany him to the library of a nearby monastery. They are accosted by gypsies en route, and in an uproarious turn of events, Danielle rescues Henry and at the end of the night, they kiss. They agree to meet the next day, but she returns home so late she loses her temper in the morning, then punches Marguérite in the eye when she discovers Marguérite intends to take her mother's wedding dress and wear it to the masque. She is beaten by Rodmilla and when she meets Henry later, Danielle is so disheartened that she is unable to tell him the truth and runs away once more. That same day, the Queen asks Marguérite and Rodmilla if they know the mysterious Comtesse de Lancret, and they realize it must be Danielle. Rodmilla tells the Queen that the Comtesse has gone to marry someone else. When they return to the manor, the Comtesse's wedding dress has disappeared and Rodmilla thinks Danielle plans on going to the masque, so she locks her in the larder. The servants get word to Da Vinci through Gustave, and he frees her and makes her a pair of wings to match her mother's wedding dress and her glass slippers, so she can go to the masque. Danielle arrives just before the King announces Henry's engagement, but before she can tell him the truth, Rodmilla accuses her of plotting to entrap the Prince by masquerading as a courtier. Henry is so shocked he spurns Danielle, saying that she's \"like the rest of them.\" Tearfully, Danielle flees, losing a slipper along the way. Henry decides to marry the Spanish Princess, but calls it off when he sees how distraught she is at the ceremony. He goes to the manor, but learns from Jacqueline that Danielle has been sold to Pierre le Pieu, a man who seems to have sexual advances on Danielle, just after the masque, so he sets out with Laurent to rescue her, but finds she has freed herself. Realizing that he loved her, he asks her to forgive him and to marry him, and she agrees happily and they kiss. The next day, Rodmilla and Marguérite are summoned to court and charged with lying to the Queen. Without a defence, the Queen strips Rodmilla of her title and sentences her and Marguérite to be banished to the Americas unless someone will speak for them. When Danielle steps forward, Henry introduces her as his wife. She asks that they receive the same courtesy they showed her, so Marguérite and Rodmilla are sent to the laundry to serve out their lives. Jacqueline is matched with Henry's acerbic squire, while Danielle and Henry live happily ever after; and the Grande Dame tells The Brothers Grimm that, \"the point, gentlemen, is that they lived.\"\n",

With all the likely candidates already claimed, young footman Albert places a bet on a \"Mr. X,\" someone totally out of the blue. Lady Alyce secretly has a romantic interest in an American no one from her family has yet met. She leaves the castle one day to venture into London, where by chance she encounters Jerry Halliday.

            "Cinderella is the much-loved only child of a widowed aristocrat. After deciding that his beloved daughter needs a mother's care, Cinderella's father marries Lady Tremaine, a proud woman with two daughters from her first marriage, Drizella and Anastasia. Plain and socially awkward, these stepsisters are bitterly envious of the beautiful and charming Cinderella. After the death of Cinderella's father, Lady Tremaine and her daughters take over the estate, and begin to abuse and mistreat Cinderella out of jealousy, and even allow their cat, Lucifer, to torment her. Despite being forced into servitude in her own home, Cinderella becomes a kind woman and befriends the animals living in the barn and many of the mice and birds who live in and around the chateau. At the royal palace, the King is distressed that his son does not intend to marry. Determined to see grandchildren, the King and the Duke organize a ball for Prince Charming in an effort to enable his son to marry, with every eligible maiden in the kingdom requested to attend. When the invitation to the ball arrives, Cinderella asks her stepmother if she can attend, since she too is an eligible maiden. Lady Tremaine agrees, provided Cinderella finishes her chores and finds something suitable to wear. Her animal friends, led by Jaq and Gus, fix a gown that belonged to Cinderella's mother, using beads and a sash cast away by Drizella and Anastasia. When Cinderella wears her dress just before departing, Lady Tremaine compliments Cinderella's gown, subtly pointing out the beads and sash. Angered by the apparent theft of the discarded items, the stepsisters destroy the gown, forcing Cinderella to remain behind while her stepfamily leaves for the royal ball. At the point of giving up her dreams, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears and bestows upon Cinderella a silver blue dress with glass slippers, and transforms a pumpkin and various animals into a carriage with horses, a coachman and a footman. Cinderella departs for the ball after the godmother warns her that the spell will break at the stroke of midnight, meaning that her dress and everything else will change back to the way they were. At the ball, the Prince rejects every girl , until he sees Cinderella. The two fall in love and dance alone throughout the castle grounds until the clock starts to chime midnight. Cinderella flees to her coach and away from the castle, inadvertently dropping one of her glass slippers. After the Duke tells the King of the disaster, they plan to find Cinderella with the slipper they recovered during her exit. The next morning, the King proclaims that the Grand Duke will visit every house in the kingdom to find the girl who fits the glass slipper, so that she can be married to the Prince. When this news reaches Cinderella's household, her stepmother and stepsisters prepare for the Grand Duke's arrival. Cinderella, overhearing the news, begins dreamily humming the song from the palace ball the previous night. Upon realizing that Cinderella is the girl who danced with the Prince, Lady Tremaine locks Cinderella up to her attic bedroom. When the Grand Duke arrives, the mice steal the key to Cinderella's room, but before they can deliver it they are ambushed by Lucifer. The animals alert Bruno, Cinderella's bloodhound, who scares Lucifer out of the house. As the Duke prepares to leave after the stepsisters unsuccessfully try on the slipper, Cinderella appears and requests to try it on. Knowing that the slipper will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman, causing him to drop the slipper, which shatters into hundreds of pieces. The Duke laments over the broken slipper, but Cinderella then produces the other glass slipper, much to her stepmother's horror. Delighted at this indisputable proof of the maiden's identity, the Duke slides the slipper onto her foot, which fits perfectly. Soon after, Cinderella and the Prince celebrate their wedding, surrounded by confetti tossed by the King, the Grand Duke and the mice.\n",

            "The movie begins with Jerry and his little nephew Tuffy  watching the Christmas ballet. Later, Jerry goes to the empty stage floor, where magic begins to happen. Toys come alive including Nelly the horse  and Paulie the Christmas Ornament . The magic then makes a Music Box Ballerina come to life, and Jerry dances with her. The stage is transformed into a wintry wonderland, where the toys are enjoying a dinner. Tom, who is in the alley looking for something to eat, hears this, and, with the other cats, raid the feast, trapping the toys. Jerry, Paulie, and Nelly try to stop this, but are shot out of a cannon. Tom traps the Ballerina in a cage, then brings her to the Cat King, who asks her to dance for him but is shot down. The Cat King tells the Ballerina there is nothing she can do about it, but she reminds him about Jerry, and that he will never give up. Later on, Tom is called to gather other cats and stop Jerry. Tuffy gives the Ballerina a string attached to a ring of keys. He then goes to warn Jerry and stop the cats. Meanwhile, Jerry, Paulie, and Nellie decide to follow the star to a man called the Toy Maker. They stop in front of a frozen river. All make it safely, except Jerry who falls in, and becomes tangled in a weed. He is freed, and is pulled up by Nelly and Paulie. This makes Paulie unravel. Tuffy gets to Tom, and dresses up as an angel and a devil. He is found out, and ends up sticking a trident in Tom's eye, causing the tower of cats to fall off of a cliff . He continues on to Jerry, warning him of the cats. Tom and his friends, disguised as Christmas trees, surround Jerry, but Tom gets attacked by squirrels, and shredded in a tree shredder. The cats attack, but the heroes escape, inside a tree. The cats beat up Tom by mistake. The heroes then come to a hill, where Paulie's head is sent flying into another hole. They go into the hole, only to find a fiery world with lava pits and dragons . A flame fairy gives Paulie his head back. A dragon wakes up, but is hypnotized by Jerry into lifting them out of the pit. They launch a cannon, which blasts Jerry and his friends into a house with clocks. Tom gives chase, but is pecked on by wooden birds.They are chased by the cats again, and run into a fairground. Tom is virtually destroyed here, being crushed again and again - of course, this being a cartoon, he always revives. They make it to a ridge, and Jerry blows up balloons with which they make it off safely. Tom, though, is blasted by cannons. One cat shoots an arrow, bursting Nelly's balloon. Tuffy grabs on to her, and unravels more of Paulie. Nelly is let down, and chased by the cats. Jerry saves her, but his grip fails him and her string slips out of his hand. The cats pull her string, and she tells them where the others are headed. The remaining three make it to the Toy Maker, who fixes Paulie and gives them a key which allows them to awaken an army of toy soldiers. The three depart with their newly attained army in order to take back their kingdom. Later, when the cats attempt to escape the army of toy soldiers, the Ballerina appears with the other toys, and she leads them in an army in rebellion against the Cat King. Tom vacuums up many of the soldiers, but the vacuum explodes, and they are blown onto the cats. Jerry and Tuffy are eaten by Tom, but Nelly returns, and throws a hammer, smashing Tom's teeth. Jerry then pushes a toy train and all the cats ride on it as it crosses the stage and exits, hitting the wall of the building next door to the theater and falling into a Dumpster. Then the Ballerina hugs Jerry telling him that she never doubted him. Soon, the wall next to them begins to crumble and collapses on Nelly. However, the magic revives her and removes her string, allowing her to talk without a string. Jerry and the Ballerina dance after receiving their crowns back. The Toy Maker and the ballerina from the Christmas play are shown to be watching from the audience; the real ballerina throws Jerry a rose, and the curtain is let down, ending the show.\n",

            "Cinderella is the much-loved only child of a widowed aristocrat. After deciding that his beloved daughter needs a mother's care, Cinderella's father marries Lady Tremaine, a proud woman with two daughters from her first marriage, Drizella and Anastasia. Plain and socially awkward, these stepsisters are bitterly envious of the beautiful and charming Cinderella. After the death of Cinderella's father, Lady Tremaine and her daughters take over the estate, and begin to abuse and mistreat Cinderella out of jealousy, and even allow their cat, Lucifer, to torment her. Despite being forced into servitude in her own home, Cinderella becomes a kind woman and befriends the animals living in the barn and many of the mice and birds who live in and around the chateau. At the royal palace, the King is distressed that his son does not intend to marry. Determined to see grandchildren, the King and the Duke organize a ball for Prince Charming in an effort to enable his son to marry, with every eligible maiden in the kingdom requested to attend. When the invitation to the ball arrives, Cinderella asks her stepmother if she can attend, since she too is an eligible maiden. Lady Tremaine agrees, provided Cinderella finishes her chores and finds something suitable to wear. Her animal friends, led by Jaq and Gus, fix a gown that belonged to Cinderella's mother, using beads and a sash cast away by Drizella and Anastasia. When Cinderella wears her dress just before departing, Lady Tremaine compliments Cinderella's gown, subtly pointing out the beads and sash. Angered by the apparent theft of the discarded items, the stepsisters destroy the gown, forcing Cinderella to remain behind while her stepfamily leaves for the royal ball. At the point of giving up her dreams, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears and bestows upon Cinderella a silver blue dress with glass slippers, and transforms a pumpkin and various animals into a carriage with horses, a coachman and a footman. Cinderella departs for the ball after the godmother warns her that the spell will break at the stroke of midnight, meaning that her dress and everything else will change back to the way they were. At the ball, the Prince rejects every girl , until he sees Cinderella. The two fall in love and dance alone throughout the castle grounds until the clock starts to chime midnight. Cinderella flees to her coach and away from the castle, inadvertently dropping one of her glass slippers. After the Duke tells the King of the disaster, they plan to find Cinderella with the slipper they recovered during her exit. The next morning, the King proclaims that the Grand Duke will visit every house in the kingdom to find the girl who fits the glass slipper, so that she can be married to the Prince. When this news reaches Cinderella's household, her stepmother and stepsisters prepare for the Grand Duke's arrival. Cinderella, overhearing the news, begins dreamily humming the song from the palace ball the previous night. Upon realizing that Cinderella is the girl who danced with the Prince, Lady Tremaine locks Cinderella up to her attic bedroom. When the Grand Duke arrives, the mice steal the key to Cinderella's room, but before they can deliver it they are ambushed by Lucifer. The animals alert Bruno, Cinderella's bloodhound, who scares Lucifer out of the house. As the Duke prepares to leave after the stepsisters unsuccessfully try on the slipper, Cinderella appears and requests to try it on. Knowing that the slipper will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman, causing him to drop the slipper, which shatters into hundreds of pieces. The Duke laments over the broken slipper, but Cinderella then produces the other glass slipper, much to her stepmother's horror. Delighted at this indisputable proof of the maiden's identity, the Duke slides the slipper onto her foot, which fits perfectly. Soon after, Cinderella and the Prince celebrate their wedding, surrounded by confetti tossed by the King, the Grand Duke and the mice.\n",

            "In the late eighteenth century, the Grande Dame of France, an elderly aristocrat, summons The Brothers Grimm to tell them the real story of the little cinder girl. She shows them a portrait of a young woman, named Danielle de Barbarac, and a glass slipper, and begins her tale. Danielle, a little girl at age eight, lives with her widowed father, Auguste, who shares with her a love of books and progressive ideas. He brings home a new wife, the haughty Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, who has two daughters about Danielle's age, Marguérite and Jacqueline. He has a heart attack soon after, and with his dying breath professes his love for Danielle rather than Rodmilla, who envies Danielle and treats her like a servant thereafter. Marguérite is as cruel as Rodmilla, but Jacqueline is kind and gentle. Ten years later, in the manor's orchard, Danielle catches a man stealing her father's horse. She unseats him with a well-aimed apple, but is horrified to learn that he is Henry, the Crown Prince of France, trying to escape the responsibilities of court. He buys her silence with a purse of gold, which she decides she will use to rescue an elderly servant sold to the Crown to pay the household's debts. She dresses as a noblewoman and goes to court to ransom the servant, where she encounters the Prince again. After the jailor refuses to release the servant, she argues against the injustice and quotes Thomas More's Utopia. Henry is so captivated that he orders the man released and begs for her name, but she evades his pleas and leaves him instead with her mother's name, the Comtesse Nicole de Lancret. When Henry returns the horse to the manor, it's plain that Rodmilla intends to match her daughter Marguérite with the Prince, despite the marriage his parents have arranged with the Spanish royals. The King strikes a bargain with the recalcitrant Prince, telling Henry to choose his own bride before they give a ball in honour of Leonardo da Vinci, who has come to court, or he will choose for him. Henry meets Danielle again by the river, where he is arguing with Da Vinci about love and fate, but again she runs away. While looking for Da Vinci soon after Henry finds Danielle's childhood friend, Gustave, who knows the whole story, and tells him Nicole de Lancret is staying with Rodmilla. When he arrives at the manor, Danielle agrees to accompany him to the library of a nearby monastery. They are accosted by gypsies en route, and in an uproarious turn of events, Danielle rescues Henry and at the end of the night, they kiss. They agree to meet the next day, but she returns home so late she loses her temper in the morning, then punches Marguérite in the eye when she discovers Marguérite intends to take her mother's wedding dress and wear it to the masque. She is beaten by Rodmilla and when she meets Henry later, Danielle is so disheartened that she is unable to tell him the truth and runs away once more. That same day, the Queen asks Marguérite and Rodmilla if they know the mysterious Comtesse de Lancret, and they realize it must be Danielle. Rodmilla tells the Queen that the Comtesse has gone to marry someone else. When they return to the manor, the Comtesse's wedding dress has disappeared and Rodmilla thinks Danielle plans on going to the masque, so she locks her in the larder. The servants get word to Da Vinci through Gustave, and he frees her and makes her a pair of wings to match her mother's wedding dress and her glass slippers, so she can go to the masque. Danielle arrives just before the King announces Henry's engagement, but before she can tell him the truth, Rodmilla accuses her of plotting to entrap the Prince by masquerading as a courtier. Henry is so shocked he spurns Danielle, saying that she's \"like the rest of them.\" Tearfully, Danielle flees, losing a slipper along the way. Henry decides to marry the Spanish Princess, but calls it off when he sees how distraught she is at the ceremony. He goes to the manor, but learns from Jacqueline that Danielle has been sold to Pierre le Pieu, a man who seems to have sexual advances on Danielle, just after the masque, so he sets out with Laurent to rescue her, but finds she has freed herself. Realizing that he loved her, he asks her to forgive him and to marry him, and she agrees happily and they kiss. The next day, Rodmilla and Marguérite are summoned to court and charged with lying to the Queen. Without a defence, the Queen strips Rodmilla of her title and sentences her and Marguérite to be banished to the Americas unless someone will speak for them. When Danielle steps forward, Henry introduces her as his wife. She asks that they receive the same courtesy they showed her, so Marguérite and Rodmilla are sent to the laundry to serve out their lives. Jacqueline is matched with Henry's acerbic squire, while Danielle and Henry live happily ever after; and the Grande Dame tells The Brothers Grimm that, \"the point, gentlemen, is that they lived.\"\n",

When he goes shopping at a lingerie store to buy some sexier clothes for her, he meets Sally, the shop girl. Rejected by his wife for a night out on the town, he takes Sally, who douses him with her perfume. When Beth smells another woman's perfume, she kicks him out and files for divorce. Beth's Aunt Kate takes her shopping to get her mind off of her broken heart. While in the dress shop, Beth overhears women gossiping about how her dull appearance led to her losing her husband. She determines to \"play their game\" and gets a new \"indecent\" wardrobe. Meanwhile the manipulative Sally convinces the dejected Robert to marry her. He finds that his second wife annoys him as much as his previous one. Later the couple and their dog end up at the same luxury hotel where divorcee Beth is strutting her stuff. She tries to seduce Robert, but he resists. Each of them quickly leaves the situation, but they meet again on a train. As they're walking away from the station, Robert slips on a banana peel. When the police arrive on the scene, Beth identifies Robert as her husband and takes him home. Doctors say he is to be kept quiet for 24 hours. The two women argue over whether Sally will move Robert against doctor's orders. Beth locks the three of them into the bedroom, which leads to a physical struggle over the key during which Sally breaks a mirror, inviting seven years bad luck.

            " Eleanor Little  and Frederick Little  and their son George Little  are intending an adoption. While George is at school, his parents go to the orphanage where they fall in love with a thoughtful, observant \"mouse\"  named Stuart Little  who knows almost everything about the other children, having been there for a long time. Despite the warnings of Mrs. Keeper  , who says that humans should not be adopting \"mice\", they decide to adopt him as their second son. Immediately after getting home, Stuart meets Snowbell  the family cat, who immediately attempts to eat him. George is surprised when his parents introduce Stuart as his new brother. He thinks it is a joke at first, but is shocked when he sees they are serious. That night, Snowbell visits Stuart and requests that he keep a low profile, so as to avoid getting seen by the other cats and damaging Snowbell's reputation. George is at first sullen and somewhat disappointed and treats Stuart with contempt. He eventually snaps at a family gathering when they encourage him to play \"catch\" with him. He also earns Snowbell's wrath when his friend, Monty the Mouth  visits for food. As Snowbell tries to keep him from seeing Stuart, he makes a scene trying to get a cereal box from a cupboard. When he sees him and discovers he is a member of the family, Monty cannot contain himself. Enraged, Snowbell chases him, who narrowly escapes by fleeing into the basement. Here, he learns that George keeps a playroom and the two interact and eventually, George comes to accept him as his brother. He also finds that George keeps a toy car just his size. They decide to work together to finish George's homemade model boat, the Wasp, for the Central Park Boat Race the following week, but Snowbell is not finished. He and Monty head to an alley that night to visit Smokey , a Mafia Don-like Russian Blue who is the leader of the alley cats. Since Snowbell doesn't want Stuart killed, he makes a plan with the alley cats to remove him from the Littles' house. On the day of the 92nd annual Central Park Boat Race, the Wasp is finished, and they arrive at Central Park. George discovers his nemesis, Anton, is there. At the same time, Stuart accidentally destroys George's remote control, rendering his boat inoperable. To make up for this, he takes control of it himself. Anton, however, attempts to cheat by ramming his much larger boat into other ones and sinking them. When he attempts to do the same thing to the Wasp, Stuart manages to bite into the line of his sail, rendering Anton's boat inoperable. He subsequently wins the race. That night, the Littles are visited by Reginald Stout and Camille Stout , a mouse couple claiming to be Stuart's parents. After discussion, he reluctantly leaves with his parents, taking the toy car with him as a goodbye present from George and they go to their home, a small toy castle on a golf course. Three days later, the Littles are visited by Mrs. Keeper, whom they had asked to do some background research on Stuart. She tells them that, according to the records, his parents died several years ago after a pile of canned food fell on them. The Littles realised that he had been kidnapped and call the police. A terrified Snowbell rushes to the alley and warns Smokey and the others about the Littles' discovery. He then decides that the only way to rectify things is to kill him. They call a meeting with Reginald and demand that he and Camille hand Stuart over. But the Stouts, having grown to care for him, reveal the truth and Reginald orders him to escape before the cats find him. He does so after saying goodbye to his \"fake parents\". Meanwhile, the Littles decide to place \"missing\" posters around the city to get help in finding him. At the Central Park, he is ambushed by Smokey and a few cats and manages to evade them by driving his car into the sewer, but he loses both the car and his luggage while escaping the storm drain. Eventually, he finds his way home just as the Littles leave to hang the posters. The only one home is Snowbell, who tells him a lie about how they are enjoying life without him, and shows him the family picture with his face cut out . He leaves again. But, Snowbell sees the pain his absence has caused and realizes his selfishness. Discovering Stuart's location from Monty and the other cats, who intend to eat him, Snowbell heads to Central Park and finds him sitting alone in a bird's nest. Snowbell turns on the other cats and escapes with him, admitting his lie to him and that the Littles actually do love him, he is in fact the only one who hates him. The cats catch up with them and Snowbell attempts to convince Smokey to call off the hit on Stuart, but is refused. Instead, he orders the cats to kill them both. Stuart responds by taking off Snowbell's collar and using it to lure them. The cats give chase, and eventually corner Stuart hanging from a tree branch. They get together on a lower one to catch him, but Snowbell breaks it at the last minute and sends them into the water below. Smokey sneaks up behind Snowbell and is about to kill him when Stuart releases a thin branch that hits him in the face and knocks him into the water. Enraged and humiliated, he walks off, only to be chased away by dogs upon turning a corner. Monty and the other cats also climb out of the water, whimpering and embarrassed. Stuart and Snowbell walk home and he shares a warm reunion with his family, telling them that Snowbell helped him get there. The Littles bring them inside and close the windows, ready for bed.\n",

            "The year is 196303 BC. A group of cavemen rises from the mud, and the first thing on their minds is finding something to eat. After two unsuccessful attempts, the group decides to eat one of their own. Suddenly, the men meet women, but don't know how to make love to them. The elder of the men sees a pair of stegosaurus performing doggystyle, which inspires the elder to do the same thing with one of the women. Nine months later, that same woman is pregnant with two boys, Ah and O. The cavemen like Ah, but are frightened by O and abandon him. Meanwhile, a brontosaurus abandons one of her eggs. Both O and the baby brontosaurus Igua meet, and instantly become friends. Years later, while trying to feed O, Igua comes across a stranded egg. Before O can try to eat it, the egg hatches and inside it is a baby pterodactyl named Croak. Croak and O become friends as well, but Igua becomes jealous and doesn't want O to see Croak again. As O grows up into an adult, he meets up with Croak again, who tries to help O become smarter. Their first \"lesson\" is how to fly. As O tries to fly, Igua steps in and takes O away. The next day, O looks in a pool of water and sees his reflection and discovers that he's a man, not a brontosaurus. He decides to leave Igua and search for his own kind. As O begins his quest, Igua tries to get together with his own kind. He finds a group of brontosauruses at a nearby lake, but they reject him due to Igua smelling too much like \"man\". Igua is crushed and decides to find O. As O begins to search for man, he comes across a group of workaholic creatures named \"No-Lobes\". They let him stay, but O causes chaos, which results in O discovering the wheel. After O destroys the No-Lobes's crops with the wheel, he is kicked out and the quest for man continues. While exploring, O is caught by a feline creature with a long tail, which she uses to seduce her victims before eating them. O decides to name her \"No-man\". \"No-man\" uses her tail to seduce O, then drags him off to her own kind. Before the felines eat him, they are distracted by a new-born baby. O and \"No-man\", who has a change of heart, run off together, with the others quickly behind them. O and \"No-man\" give them the slip, then they both have sex. While the two sleep, they are interrupted by a stampede of giant turtles. The feline tribe catches up with them, and catches \"No-man\". O uses a lone giant turtle shell and a couple of wheels to ride up to the tribe and tries to catch \"No-man\", but misses. O rolls off into the desert, leaving \"No-man\" to have her tail cut off. O crashes into a palm tree in the middle of the desert and is left to walk again. Later, O runs into Croak again. O is in need of water, and Croak just happens to be searching for water. They find what appears to be water, but before O can drink, he is stopped by a dragon. The dragon tries to breathe fire at O, but it comes out his buttocks instead. To get water, O decides to help the dragon by sticking a cork up the dragon's butt. This causes the dragon to breathe fire from his mouth. The dragon thanks O and lets him drink. However, the water is polluted, but the dragon gives him a lift to a nearby lake. After O drinks plenty of water, he takes a brief nap. When he wakes up, he sees that he's tied down to the ground by a colony of ants. O gets himself free and climbs up a tall building made out of grass, which cracks and sends O crashing into a pool of water, which drowns half of the ants. O continues on to the Arctic, and meets up with a group of Norwegian barbarians. O shows them fire, which intrigues the group. They use their fur coats to light up the fire even more, but the fire melts the ice and their coats are lost in the bottom of the ocean. The group chases after O, but Croak flies in and saves him. As Croak flies O to safety, O is eaten by a shark. O eventually escapes from the shark and finally meets his human family. The elder recognizes O and instantly dies. O takes over as leader and tells them that he'll teach man what he has learned on his travels. While teaching them, Igua finally catches up with O. However, O is still angry at Igua. Meanwhile, Ah  takes over as leader and shoves O away into the fire that was made by Ah. Igua saves him, and both O and Igua reconcile their friendship. Ah  tells his people that they must show the world who is boss. They kill off the \"No-Lobes\", the dinosaurs commit suicide, the dragon disappears from the face of the earth, the feline tribe is skinned alive , and the ants make a rocket made out of grass, which plummets into the ground, which causes the Earth to split into continents. As for O, Igua, and Croak, they spend the rest of their days on an uncharted island. Croak keeps busy by carving Easter Island heads, and O takes the title as the missing link.\n",

            " :Original Croatian character names are in parentheses. Lapitch , a small orphan mouse, works in a small town as the apprentice of the Scowlers—a mean-mannered shoemaker , and his kind-hearted wife . His dog, Brewster , keeps him company when he is alone. One day, Master Scowler awaits a visit from the Mayor  and his son ; Lapitch has to make sure the pigs' boots are the right size. When the piglet tries to put them on, things do not go well, and the two patrons leave for good. Lapitch tries to tell the Master it was not his fault, yet he still blames his young apprentice for the mistake. After Lapitch gets scolded, Mistress Scowler apologises for her husband's bad behaviour. While he tidies up, she tells the young mouse that she and her husband used to be happier ages ago. Lapitch wants to know why, but the Mistress vows only to tell him when he is older. That night, Lapitch writes a letter to the Scowlers and leaves the village, wearing the piglet's boots. Although Lapitch has said good-bye to Brewster, the dog joins him the following morning. Eventually, the two of them visit a young squirrel named Marco , who lives in a house with a blue star on its walls, and help him round up some geese that went astray while he was tending to the flock. At evening, Marco's mother thanks them by serving a luscious supper. An awkward raccoon, Melvin , eavesdrops on the group's conversation. Hearing of a valuable treasure stored inside their house, he runs off to tell his boss, the evil Dirty Rat , about the goods. When morning comes, Lapitch and Brewster say farewell to the squirrels. The road ahead, however, does not go smoothly: an afternoon of unusual weather culminates in an evening storm, and they must find shelter. When they do, under an old bridge they meet Dirty Rat himself, and sleep next to him. Because of Dirty Rat—\"king of the Underworld\" as he is known—Lapitch wakes up shocked to see his boots gone. As he looks for the shiny pair, he meets Lisa —another orphan mouse—and her parrot Pico ; both came from a circus whose ringmaster treated them badly and left them behind. During their journey, the two mice and their pets meet Melvin's hardworking mother and help her chop wood. Worried about her son's bad deeds, Melvin's mother gives Lapitch a silver coin for luck before they go off. The mouse later gives it to the raccoon, after he falls off Dirty Rat's wagon. Soon, the group team up with some villagers to extinguish a fire, but the villagers make Melvin a suspect in the area's recent robbery sting. In addition, the group encounters a poor woman named Yana , whose magic powers give Lapitch the courage to face the evil Dirty Rat. After the gang comes to a circus, Lisa entertains the patrons of an under-used merry-go-round. As night falls, she reunites with her horse, Blanka , after hearing its neigh. But a nasty surprise awaits everyone: Dirty Rat makes a deal with Lisa's ringmaster in which he vows to reach Marco's house with a fast horse, and steal the family chest. Lapitch and friends plan to stop him for good when they hear this. Later on, they meet Master Scowler, whom Melvin has just rescued. Scowler tells them he was robbed and tied up in a tree for two days. They all set forth to put an end to Dirty Rat; Melvin gives them a hand, but his boss ties him and swings him out of the way. A determined Lapitch, guided by Yana and her wise advice, comes to terms with the villain's schemes. Dirty Rat is so enraged that his horse charges straight at the little mouse, about to trample him. At the last moment, a bolt of lightning splits the harness; the Rat and his cart fall down a cliff, encased in huge boulders. The clouds clear as soon as everyone celebrates. Then, Lisa tames Dirty Rat's black horse, and gives it to Melvin, who promises to live a good life after what he has gone through. The next day, Lapitch, Lisa and the rest arrive at Marco's house, where his mother shows them the family's valuable treasure; she also receives Melvin's coin. When they leave, they meet Marco's father, gone for a long time after working in a faraway land. Back home, a worried Mistress Scowler is delighted to see everyone back again—Brewster, Master Scowler, Lapitch and Lisa. By then, she and her husband finally recognise Lisa, the orphan circus star, as their lone child Susanna. The Scowlers have their happiest moment ever due to this; afterwards, Master plays a pleasant tune on his violin, and everybody dances to it. Eventually, the Scowlers rekindle their relationship, and the town dwellers celebrate along with them. In time, Lapitch becomes the most respected shoemaker they have ever known.\n",

            "The film opens with newspaper photojournalist Audrey Aimes  accidentally stumbling upon a small town in Illinois which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright , who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo. The tension in the film rises as the audience sees gigantic mutant locusts rampaging over the countryside. Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson , Colonel Sturgeon , and Captain Barton  to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and began to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings. General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts en masse is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The lure itself will be a tape recording of the locust mating call. The plan is put into effect, and it works at the last possible moment. The monstrous locusts drown, but Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops. They ponder whether the whole world might be facing an attack of monstrous creatures.\n",

The food mysteriously bubbles up from the ground on a remote island somewhere in British Columbia. The couple that discover it, Mr. and Mrs. Skinner  consider it a gift from God, and promptly begin feeding it to their chickens. Soon, rats, wasps, and worms consume the substance, and the island is crawling with giant vermin. One night, some of them kill Mr. Skinner. Morgan, a professional football player , and his buddies are camping on the island, and one of them is stung to death by giant wasps. After ferrying his friends back to the mainland, Morgan returns to investigate. Also thrown into the mix are Thomas and Rita, an expecting couple; Jack Bensington, the owner of a dog food company  hoping to market the substance; and his assistant Lorna , a \"lady bacteriologist.\" Eventually, the survivors are trapped in the farmhouse with the rats swarming around outside, and Mrs. Skinner, Morgan's friend Brian, and Bensington are killed by the rats. Morgan eventually blows up a nearby dam, flooding the area and drowning the rats, whose size and weight renders them unable to swim. The food, however, survives. It is swept into a river and is consumed by cows, who give tainted milk, which is then drunk by schoolchildren.\n",

            " Eleanor Little  and Frederick Little  and their son George Little  are intending an adoption. While George is at school, his parents go to the orphanage where they fall in love with a thoughtful, observant \"mouse\"  named Stuart Little  who knows almost everything about the other children, having been there for a long time. Despite the warnings of Mrs. Keeper  , who says that humans should not be adopting \"mice\", they decide to adopt him as their second son. Immediately after getting home, Stuart meets Snowbell  the family cat, who immediately attempts to eat him. George is surprised when his parents introduce Stuart as his new brother. He thinks it is a joke at first, but is shocked when he sees they are serious. That night, Snowbell visits Stuart and requests that he keep a low profile, so as to avoid getting seen by the other cats and damaging Snowbell's reputation. George is at first sullen and somewhat disappointed and treats Stuart with contempt. He eventually snaps at a family gathering when they encourage him to play \"catch\" with him. He also earns Snowbell's wrath when his friend, Monty the Mouth  visits for food. As Snowbell tries to keep him from seeing Stuart, he makes a scene trying to get a cereal box from a cupboard. When he sees him and discovers he is a member of the family, Monty cannot contain himself. Enraged, Snowbell chases him, who narrowly escapes by fleeing into the basement. Here, he learns that George keeps a playroom and the two interact and eventually, George comes to accept him as his brother. He also finds that George keeps a toy car just his size. They decide to work together to finish George's homemade model boat, the Wasp, for the Central Park Boat Race the following week, but Snowbell is not finished. He and Monty head to an alley that night to visit Smokey , a Mafia Don-like Russian Blue who is the leader of the alley cats. Since Snowbell doesn't want Stuart killed, he makes a plan with the alley cats to remove him from the Littles' house. On the day of the 92nd annual Central Park Boat Race, the Wasp is finished, and they arrive at Central Park. George discovers his nemesis, Anton, is there. At the same time, Stuart accidentally destroys George's remote control, rendering his boat inoperable. To make up for this, he takes control of it himself. Anton, however, attempts to cheat by ramming his much larger boat into other ones and sinking them. When he attempts to do the same thing to the Wasp, Stuart manages to bite into the line of his sail, rendering Anton's boat inoperable. He subsequently wins the race. That night, the Littles are visited by Reginald Stout and Camille Stout , a mouse couple claiming to be Stuart's parents. After discussion, he reluctantly leaves with his parents, taking the toy car with him as a goodbye present from George and they go to their home, a small toy castle on a golf course.

            "The film begins with New Mexico State Police Sergeant Ben Peterson  and his patrol partner Ed Blackburn  discovering a little girl wandering the desert near Alamogordo, mute and in a state of shock. They retrace her steps to a trailer owned by an FBI agent named Ellinson, who was on vacation in the area with his wife and two children. The side of the trailer has been ripped open from the outside, and the rest of the family is missing and presumed dead. The girl briefly responds when strange sounds echo out of the desert wind, but the troopers and medic miss this. More mysterious deaths and disappearances occur in the area. A general store owner named Gramps Johnson is found dead in his store, which had been literally torn apart. All the money is left in the register, but a barrel of sugar had been smashed open, and Gramps' empty rifle has been fired empty and bent in half. Peterson leaves to check on the little girl and make a report leaving Blackburn to guard Gramps' store. Not long afterward, Blackburn hears a strange noise outside and goes out to investigate. Soon there is the sound of several gunshots, the strange sound gets louder, and Blackburn is heard screaming in agony, whereupon he disappears as well. Later, FBI agent Robert Graham  has arrived to assist. A single strange track bigger than a mountain lion’s has been found in the desert near the trailer, and a plaster cast of it was made and sent to Washington, D.C. The police think there is a maniac killer on the loose, but Peterson's boss points out that Gramps got off several shots with his 30-30 and was “a dead shot and could hit anything he could see”. So, the police commander says, “unless the attacker is armored like a battleship, there’s no maniac killer in this case.” Even more puzzling is the coroner's verdict about the possible causes of death found on Gramps Johnson's body: “Gramps could have died any one of five ways. His neck and back were broken, his skull was fractured, his chest was crushed... and here’s one for Sherlock Holmes. There was enough formic acid in his body to kill twenty men.” When the FBI is unable to identify the footprint, it attracts the attention of Harold  and Pat Medford , a father/daughter team of entomologists from the Department of Agriculture. The elder Dr. Medford arrives on the scene with a theory, but will not go into it until he tries an experiment on the Ellinson girl and sees the site where they found the track. In the hospital, he has her smell the contents of a vial containing formic acid, whereupon she emerges from her state of catatonic withdrawal and screams, \"Them! Them!\" Medford's theory is validated when, back at the torn-up trailer, he sees the track, measuring an astonishing eighteen centimeters, making the “creature” almost eight feet in length. Both Graham and Peterson are upset that the doctor has not let them in on what he thinks is happening, but he explains that he is trying to avoid a nationwide panic. As they talk, his daughter encounters a giant foraging ant. The lawmen empty their revolvers at the monster, to little effect. On Medford's advice, Peterson, using a Thompson submachine gun, and Graham finally kill it by shooting off the creature's antennae, blinding it, then emptying the Thomson into it. Medford finally tells them what it is: an ant. He theorizes it was mutated by the radiation from the first atom bomb tests, close by at Alamogordo. A U.S. Air Force unit is brought in, led by General O'Brien , which locates the ants' nest and exterminates the inhabitants with poison gas. However, the younger Dr. Medford finds evidence that two young queens have hatched and flown away to establish new colonies. Trying to avoid a general panic, the government covertly investigates any reports of unusual activities or sightings of \"flying saucers\". One report leads them to a railroad car which has been caved in and forty tons of sugar taken. The guard is irate at being accused of being in on it. \"Who's going to steal forty tons of sugar? Is there a black market for it?\" Another report takes them to a local hospital and a pilot named Crotty, who was forced down by U.F.O.s that he says resembled giant ants. He’s confined to the psycho ward, but the doctor – who is about to release him, saying it’s all a publicity stunt – is warned to keep him locked up and without any visitors so he gets no publicity. They’ll call later and tell the doctor when Crotty can be released. One of the queens is finally revealed to have invaded the hold of an ocean-going freighter which had been docked for off-loading and hatches left open. It has been overrun by ants who then slaughter the crew. The vessel is sunk by a U.S. Navy cruiser. Then, an alcoholic in a hospital \"drunk tank\" reveals that he saw giant ants flying around outside his window, and the dismembered corpse of a man last seen with his two young sons  leads the investigation to the storm drain system that empties into the Los Angeles River. Given the significant threat to the City, the U.S. Army goes public with the existence of the giant ants, declares martial law for the city, and prepares for a major assault on the new nest. During the assault, Peterson finds the two missing boys alive but trapped near the ants' nest. He calls for backup but, seeing that the boys are in imminent danger, goes in alone before help can arrive. He gets the boys to safety in the pipe through which he came. Before Peterson himself can escape, he is grabbed from behind in the mandibles of another ant and mortally wounded. Graham arrives at the scene with reinforcements, and they fight off the swarming ants. Graham is nearly killed himself when a cave-in temporarily cuts him off from the rest of the men; several ants charge him, but he is able to hold them off long enough for the other troops to tunnel through the debris and come to his rescue. The nest's queen and egg chamber are then destroyed with flamethrowers. The senior Dr. Medford issues a grim warning that \"the atomic genie has been let out of the bottle,\" and further horrors may await mankind. He solemnly intones, \"When man entered the atomic age, he opened the door to a new world. What we may eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict.\"\n",

Lapitch , a small orphan mouse, works in a small town as the apprentice of the Scowlers—a mean-mannered shoemaker , and his kind-hearted wife . His dog, Brewster , keeps him company when he is alone. One day, Master Scowler awaits a visit from the Mayor  and his son ; Lapitch has to make sure the pigs' boots are the right size. When the piglet tries to put them on, things do not go well, and the two patrons leave for good. Lapitch tries to tell the Master it was not his fault, yet he still blames his young apprentice for the mistake. After Lapitch gets scolded, Mistress Scowler apologises for her husband's bad behaviour. While he tidies up, she tells the young mouse that she and her husband used to be happier ages ago. Lapitch wants to know why, but the Mistress vows only to tell him when he is older. That night, Lapitch writes a letter to the Scowlers and leaves the village, wearing the piglet's boots. Although Lapitch has said good-bye to Brewster, the dog joins him the following morning. Eventually, the two of them visit a young squirrel named Marco , who lives in a house with a blue star on its walls, and help him round up some geese that went astray while he was tending to the flock. At evening, Marco's mother thanks them by serving a luscious supper. An awkward raccoon, Melvin , eavesdrops on the group's conversation. Hearing of a valuable treasure stored inside their house, he runs off to tell his boss, the evil Dirty Rat , about the goods. When morning comes, Lapitch and Brewster say farewell to the squirrels. The road ahead, however, does not go smoothly: an afternoon of unusual weather culminates in an evening storm, and they must find shelter. When they do, under an old bridge they meet Dirty Rat himself, and sleep next to him. Because of Dirty Rat—\"king of the Underworld\" as he is known—Lapitch wakes up shocked to see his boots gone. As he looks for the shiny pair, he meets Lisa —another orphan mouse—and her parrot Pico ; both came from a circus whose ringmaster treated them badly and left them behind. During their journey, the two mice and their pets meet Melvin's hardworking mother and help her chop wood. Worried about her son's bad deeds, Melvin's mother gives Lapitch a silver coin for luck before they go off. The mouse later gives it to the raccoon, after he falls off Dirty Rat's wagon. Soon, the group team up with some villagers to extinguish a fire, but the villagers make Melvin a suspect in the area's recent robbery sting. In addition, the group encounters a poor woman named Yana , whose magic powers give Lapitch the courage to face the evil Dirty Rat. After the gang comes to a circus, Lisa entertains the patrons of an under-used merry-go-round. As night falls, she reunites with her horse, Blanka , after hearing its neigh. But a nasty surprise awaits everyone: Dirty Rat makes a deal with Lisa's ringmaster in which he vows to reach Marco's house with a fast horse, and steal the family chest. Lapitch and friends plan to stop him for good when they hear this. Later on, they meet Master Scowler, whom Melvin has just rescued. Scowler tells them he was robbed and tied up in a tree for two days. They all set forth to put an end to Dirty Rat; Melvin gives them a hand, but his boss ties him and swings him out of the way. A determined Lapitch, guided by Yana and her wise advice, comes to terms with the villain's schemes. Dirty Rat is so enraged that his horse charges straight at the little mouse, about to trample him. At the last moment, a bolt of lightning splits the harness; the Rat and his cart fall down a cliff, encased in huge boulders. The clouds clear as soon as everyone celebrates. Then, Lisa tames Dirty Rat's black horse, and gives it to Melvin, who promises to live a good life after what he has gone through. The next day, Lapitch, Lisa and the rest arrive at Marco's house, where his mother shows them the family's valuable treasure; she also receives Melvin's coin. When they leave, they meet Marco's father, gone for a long time after working in a faraway land. Back home, a worried Mistress Scowler is delighted to see everyone back again—Brewster, Master Scowler, Lapitch and Lisa. By then, she and her husband finally recognise Lisa, the orphan circus star, as their lone child Susanna. The Scowlers have their happiest moment ever due to this; afterwards, Master plays a pleasant tune on his violin, and everybody dances to it. Eventually, the Scowlers rekindle their relationship, and the town dwellers celebrate along with them. In time, Lapitch becomes the most respected shoemaker they have ever known.\n",

            "The year is 196303 BC. A group of cavemen rises from the mud, and the first thing on their minds is finding something to eat. After two unsuccessful attempts, the group decides to eat one of their own. Suddenly, the men meet women, but don't know how to make love to them. The elder of the men sees a pair of stegosaurus performing doggystyle, which inspires the elder to do the same thing with one of the women. Nine months later, that same woman is pregnant with two boys, Ah and O. The cavemen like Ah, but are frightened by O and abandon him. Meanwhile, a brontosaurus abandons one of her eggs. Both O and the baby brontosaurus Igua meet, and instantly become friends. Years later, while trying to feed O, Igua comes across a stranded egg. Before O can try to eat it, the egg hatches and inside it is a baby pterodactyl named Croak. Croak and O become friends as well, but Igua becomes jealous and doesn't want O to see Croak again. As O grows up into an adult, he meets up with Croak again, who tries to help O become smarter. Their first \"lesson\" is how to fly. As O tries to fly, Igua steps in and takes O away. The next day, O looks in a pool of water and sees his reflection and discovers that he's a man, not a brontosaurus. He decides to leave Igua and search for his own kind. As O begins his quest, Igua tries to get together with his own kind. He finds a group of brontosauruses at a nearby lake, but they reject him due to Igua smelling too much like \"man\". Igua is crushed and decides to find O. As O begins to search for man, he comes across a group of workaholic creatures named \"No-Lobes\". They let him stay, but O causes chaos, which results in O discovering the wheel. After O destroys the No-Lobes's crops with the wheel, he is kicked out and the quest for man continues. While exploring, O is caught by a feline creature with a long tail, which she uses to seduce her victims before eating them. O decides to name her \"No-man\". \"No-man\" uses her tail to seduce O, then drags him off to her own kind. Before the felines eat him, they are distracted by a new-born baby. O and \"No-man\", who has a change of heart, run off together, with the others quickly behind them. O and \"No-man\" give them the slip, then they both have sex. While the two sleep, they are interrupted by a stampede of giant turtles. The feline tribe catches up with them, and catches \"No-man\". O uses a lone giant turtle shell and a couple of wheels to ride up to the tribe and tries to catch \"No-man\", but misses. O rolls off into the desert, leaving \"No-man\" to have her tail cut off. O crashes into a palm tree in the middle of the desert and is left to walk again. Later, O runs into Croak again. O is in need of water, and Croak just happens to be searching for water. They find what appears to be water, but before O can drink, he is stopped by a dragon. The dragon tries to breathe fire at O, but it comes out his buttocks instead. To get water, O decides to help the dragon by sticking a cork up the dragon's butt. This causes the dragon to breathe fire from his mouth. The dragon thanks O and lets him drink. However, the water is polluted, but the dragon gives him a lift to a nearby lake. After O drinks plenty of water, he takes a brief nap. When he wakes up, he sees that he's tied down to the ground by a colony of ants. O gets himself free and climbs up a tall building made out of grass, which cracks and sends O crashing into a pool of water, which drowns half of the ants. O continues on to the Arctic, and meets up with a group of Norwegian barbarians. O shows them fire, which intrigues the group. They use their fur coats to light up the fire even more, but the fire melts the ice and their coats are lost in the bottom of the ocean. The group chases after O, but Croak flies in and saves him. As Croak flies O to safety, O is eaten by a shark. O eventually escapes from the shark and finally meets his human family. The elder recognizes O and instantly dies. O takes over as leader and tells them that he'll teach man what he has learned on his travels. While teaching them, Igua finally catches up with O. However, O is still angry at Igua. Meanwhile, Ah  takes over as leader and shoves O away into the fire that was made by Ah. Igua saves him, and both O and Igua reconcile their friendship. Ah  tells his people that they must show the world who is boss. They kill off the \"No-Lobes\", the dinosaurs commit suicide, the dragon disappears from the face of the earth, the feline tribe is skinned alive , and the ants make a rocket made out of grass, which plummets into the ground, which causes the Earth to split into continents. As for O, Igua, and Croak, they spend the rest of their days on an uncharted island. Croak keeps busy by carving Easter Island heads, and O takes the title as the missing link.\n",

            "Roddy St. James  is a decidedly upper crust pet mouse who makes his home in a posh Kensington flat. While his owners are away on holiday Roddy plays around the house. When a common sewer rat named Sid  comes spewing out of the sink and decides to stay, especially as England are playing against Germany in the World Cup final, Roddy schemes to get rid of Sid by luring him into the \"jacuzzi\", which is actually the toilet. Sid isn't fooled however, and instead pushes Roddy in and flushes him away into the sewer. There, Roddy discovers an city resembling London made out of various bits of junk, and meets Rita Malone , an enterprising scavenger rat who works the drains in her faithful boat, the Jammy Dodger. Rita does not like Roddy initially, but ends up taking him along, while her arch enemy The Toad  sends his rat henchmen, Spike  and Whitey , after her because she had stolen back her father's prized ruby a long time ago. The Toad despises all rodents to the point of hateful obsession. He decides to have them frozen with liquid nitrogen inside an icemaker. The pair escape, and Rita takes a unique electrical cable. The cable is required to control the Floodgates.  Roddy finds that the ruby is a fake and breaks it in front of Rita, enraging her, for she can now not get the money she needs for her large family. Roddy offers her a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington. Accepting the offer, the pair first stop to visit her family before setting off. During Roddy's stay, he overhears a conversation that causes him to think that Rita had double-crossed him, so he steals the Jammy Dodger. When Rita catches up to him, she is able to clear up the misunderstanding. The pair evade Spike and Whitey pursuing in a remote-controlled toy boat, with Thimblenose Ted and others on eggbeater jet skis. During this scene, Roddy and Rita share a quick love moment. Incensed at his minions’ repeated failures, The Toad sends for his French cousin; an infamous, if somewhat laid back, mercenary known as Le Frog . During this scene, it is revealed that The Toad was once Prince Charles' pet, but was replaced by a pet mouse, and subsequently flushed down a toilet. Le Frog and his subordinates intercept the duo and retrieve the cable, but Roddy and Rita use a plastic bag to lift themselves out of the sewer  and get Roddy home, though the Jammy Dodger has to be sacrificed. Back home, Roddy pays Rita the promised ruby and an emerald, then proceeds to show her around his house. She at first believes he has family in the home, but noticing his cage, she realizes he's a pet. Roddy tries to pass Sid off as his brother, but Sid and Rita know each other, and so she doesn't fall for it. Rita tries to persuade Roddy to come with her, but he is too proud to admit that he is lonely. By now, they have fallen in love but have not told each other their feelings. She departs, both of them broken-hearted, but is soon captured by The Toad. Talking to Sid about half-time, Roddy pieces together The Toad's plan: to open the gates during halftime of the World Cup, when all the humans will most likely be using their toilets, causing a great flood and drowning the rats and their underground city in sewage. He can then use the depopulated city as a home for millions of his own tadpole offspring. He gives Sid his cushy position and has him flush him back to the sewers to find Rita and save the city. Together, they defeat The Toad and freeze the wave of sewage generated by the flushing of countless toilets during half-time with liquid nitrogen before it drowns the entire rat population. Rita and Roddy build the Jammy Dodger Mark Two and set off in her with Rita's entire brood. A newspaper article reveals England had lost on penalties. Rita and Roddy become boyfriend and girlfriend. Later while the credits start, Roddy's former owner Tabitha comes back with a new pet , which frightens Sid.\n",

            "The film reduced the tale to an 'Ecology Strikes Back' scenario, common in science fiction movies at the time. The food mysteriously bubbles up from the ground on a remote island somewhere in British Columbia. The couple that discover it, Mr. and Mrs. Skinner  consider it a gift from God, and promptly begin feeding it to their chickens. Soon, rats, wasps, and worms consume the substance, and the island is crawling with giant vermin. One night, some of them kill Mr. Skinner. Morgan, a professional football player , and his buddies are camping on the island, and one of them is stung to death by giant wasps. After ferrying his friends back to the mainland, Morgan returns to investigate. Also thrown into the mix are Thomas and Rita, an expecting couple; Jack Bensington, the owner of a dog food company  hoping to market the substance; and his assistant Lorna , a \"lady bacteriologist.\" Eventually, the survivors are trapped in the farmhouse with the rats swarming around outside, and Mrs. Skinner, Morgan's friend Brian, and Bensington are killed by the rats. Morgan eventually blows up a nearby dam, flooding the area and drowning the rats, whose size and weight renders them unable to swim. The food, however, survives. It is swept into a river and is consumed by cows, who give tainted milk, which is then drunk by schoolchildren.\n",

            " It is Labor Day weekend, 1946. Young, virginal Ida Parsons innocuously plays as her father hosts a raucous party. Amid the festivities, an older, drunken man named Tom Rice staggers outside and propositions Ida. When she refuses, he chases her into the woods and brutally rapes her; her dogs break out of their pen and they attack and fatally maul Ida's rapist. After the credits, the movie picks up in 1982. Preppy brothers Eric and Nick are borrowing their father's yacht to take their girlfriends, Sandy and Donna, on a weekend outing along with their sister, Carla. At the outset of the trip, Nick demonstrates his intent to be the \"alpha male\" of the trip, insisting that he be the one to pilot the yacht and at one point pulling a gun on Eric to demonstrate his authority. As the tensions rise between Nick and Eric, Donna and Carla engage in girl-talk, and geeky Carla silently laments that she is the sole member of the cruise who came along without a significant other. That night, fog settles in; Eric and Nick, hearing cries out on the water, discover and rescue a shipwrecked fisherman named Bert. Bert informs them that he wrecked offshore Dog Island, the home of lumber baroness Ida Parsons, who has used her family fortune to hole herself up on the island for the past thirty-five years; now she only makes two annual voyages onto the mainland for necessary supplies, and has never spoken to anyone during these trips. Recovering from the onset of hypothermia, Bert tells the quintet a campfire story about the savagery of the wild dogs which roam Ida's island, acting as her sentries. The story, coupled with the cries of wild animals coming from the nearby island, startle Nick enough that he runs on top of the yacht and tries to speed back to the mainland; instead, he wrecks it, damaging the fuel line and causing it to explode. Donna, Eric, Sandy, Nick, and Bert wash up on Dog Island; Bert has been seriously wounded, and Carla is nowhere to be found. Seeking to reclaim his macho status, Nick wanders off into the woods, and is subsequently killed by a hulking figure that breaks down the shed where Nick hides. The next morning, Sandy and Eric go off onto the island, hoping that Ida Parsons will help them get back to the mainland. Shortly after they leave the beach, Bert goes into shock, and Donna desperately tries to warm him by stripping to the waist and lying topless across his shirtless torso; seconds later, the same figure which killed Nick sneaks up behind Donna and Bert, fatally hurling Donna against a rock wall and decapitating Bert. At the center of the island, Sandy and Eric discover Ida's fortified cabin, as well as the fact that all of Ida's dogs have died long ago, their mutilated skeletons lying in their pens. In Ida's boathouse, the duo discover Carla alive hiding under a tarp; she apparently washed up at another point on the beach and made it to the compound in the middle of the night. In the course of exploring Ida's compound, Eric, Sandy and Carla discover a dust-covered nursery full of antique toys, and a cobweb-covered crib; they also discover Ida Parson's diary, which contains insane, rambling passages about giving birth to a sick child, which she intends to keep sinless by secluding him from all the evils of the outside world. They figure something traumatic must've happened to Ida to cause her to write such things, and reach the conclusion that Ida's son has died, causing her to become delusional. As they continue exploring the house, Sandy comes across Ida's skeletal corpse, positioned in repose in her bedroom. The kids listen to something growling in the basement and become frightened, and decide to collect supplies and head back to the shore to collect the rest of their party so they can formulate an escape from the island in Ida's old rowboat. Even so, they go in the basement to see what they can use. But then they find the dead bodies of Nick and Donna, panic and run away back to the beach. Eric and Sandy decide that the one who did it must be Ida Parson's son, left insane by his life of solitude under the care of the imbalanced Ida; with nothing to do but learn from Ida and explore the wilderness, he's become immensely strong, a capable tracker and hunter, and is thoroughly convinced that all outsiders are a threat to him and his mother. With the death of Ida, he was left without any basis for reality, and ended up eating the dogs to survive—and has now turned to people. Eric and Sandy go back to the house and get the matches that Sandy dropped earlier. Ida's son attacks, breaking down the door. Eric attempts to fight using a broken branch, but the mutant grapples with him and fatally breaks Eric's back; once it has killed Eric, it turns it attention to Sandy and chases her upstairs into his mother's bedroom, where Sandy wraps a blanket around her head and, playing Ida, convinces the mutant to leave his mother's bedroom. But when Sandy leaves the room, the mutant is there and pursues Sandy out of the house and to the boathouse. Sandy runs headlong into Carla at the boathouse and the mutant, close behind, grabs Carla and crushes her face and kills her. Sandy manages to lure the man into Ida's boathouse, which she sets on fire; Ida's son is mortally burned in the blaze, but still manages to leap from the water and attack Sandy, chasing her up a hill where she yanks a sharp signpost from the ground and impales the mutant with it. As he dies, we finally see his burned and deformed face. Traumatized by the death of her friends and the murder she has been forced to commit, Sandy sits alone on Ida's dock, strongly resembling a scarred and traumatized Ida.\n",

            "The film opens with newspaper photojournalist Audrey Aimes  accidentally stumbling upon a small town in Illinois which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright , who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo. The tension in the film rises as the audience sees gigantic mutant locusts rampaging over the countryside. Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson , Colonel Sturgeon , and Captain Barton  to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and began to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings. General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts en masse is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The lure itself will be a tape recording of the locust mating call. The plan is put into effect, and it works at the last possible moment. The monstrous locusts drown, but Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops. They ponder whether the whole world might be facing an attack of monstrous creatures.\n",

At the feast afterwards, we learn that a brunette woman, Ayak, is interested in Tara, but he is fascinated with Sanna who has set up a hut. He brings her food. After a fight between Sanna and Ayak in the water, Sanna's former tribe arrives, looking for her. She flees and is followed by pursuers. Hiding in a tree, a boa tries to wrap itself around her but attacks and kills one of the men, whom the three other men can't help. They think Sanna is in a nearby cave, but a Chasmosaurus attacks instead, wounding the men. Vultures, not content as scavengers, take swipes at the wounded. When Tara seeks Sanna, he finds the one man dead and, after the triceratops charges and runs off a cliff, rescues the others. A funeral pyre at sea is followed by a tribal frenzy during which Sanna's hut gets burned and Tara runs away. Sanna meanwhile has faced a vicious prehistoric long-tongued lizard and is nearly eaten by a plant. She cuts off her hair to escape the plant. Tara unfortunately thinks Sanna has been eaten by the man-eating plant. Sanna sleeps in a large dinosaur eggshell. The other egg hatches and the dinosaur imprints. The parent, thinking Sanna has hatched, brings her a deer carcass. Sanna plays with her new sibling. She dives and catches fish in her teeth. She finds her dinosaur involved in a fight with a few men, and she calls off the dinosaur. After an incident involving Tara vs. a giant Rhamphorhynchus, he and Sanna reunite and go to her cave, witnessed by a lookout.

They train in Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley where they are preparing for war in Afghanistan. Teaching them, is very demanding commander Ensign Dygalo - a veteran of Afghanistan war, who lost all of his friends in battle. During the service recruits became true friends and real soldiers, they befriend a local woman who is more than happy to support the morale of the soldiers. On their arrival at Baghram air base they greet soldiers returning home. One of them from Kraasnoyarsk gives Lyutyy the talisman. But in escaping from the base of the plane with the veterans gets hit by a Stinger, the plane makes an unsuccessful landing and explodes. All veterans were killed. Main heroes befriend with new Co-workers, who were Dygalo's friends. The story ends at a bloody battle on a mountain top in Afghanistan against the mujahideen. Only Lyutyy survives. The film is loosely based on a real-life battle that took place at Hill 3234 in early 1988, during the last large-scale Soviet military operation Magistral. Numerous Soviet armored vehicles and aircraft appear in the film which are rarely seen or depicted in Western films. In the film, only one soldier from the company survives unscathed and the company is said to have been \"forgotten\" by the military command because of the Soviet withdrawal. In reality, the 9th Company, 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment was pinned down under heavy fire on Hill 3234 from 7-8 January 1988. They managed to stop 3 attacks by an estimated 200-250 mujahideen. The company lost a total of 6 men. Another 28 out of the total 39 were seriously wounded. Four of the killed soldiers were posthumously awarded the golden star of the Hero of the Soviet Union. The unit was in constant communication with headquarters and got everything the regimental commander, Colonel Valery Vostrotin, could provide in terms of rations, ammunition, reinforcements, and helicopter evacuation of the wounded.Schofield, The Russian Elite, Greenhill, 1993, pp. 120-125\n",

            "Eddie Muntz  is a small-time American arms dealer who talks his way into a job with a large defense corporation selling high-tech military unmanned aerial vehicles to a South American dictator . Muntz arrives in war-torn and impoverished \"San Miguel\" to sell weapons to both its leader and the rebels seeking his ouster. In the middle of a sales pitch to the rebels, Muntz is caught in a firefight and is shot in the foot. Hobbling in a rundown hotel days later, Muntz meets Harold DeVoto , a sales rep for the American defense contractor, Luckup. Muntz peddles small arms , whereas Luckup's product is more sophisticated—the Peacemaker UAV, a military dream that operates without pilots or airbases. But the military junta of San Miguel strings DeVoto along, driving the man to suicide. Muntz successfully takes over the deal and wins a contract worth millions. On returning to America, he is angrily confronted at gunpoint by Catherine , Harold's widow. Demanding the contract, Catherine shoots Muntz instead, reopening the wound on his foot. Waking up in the hospital, Muntz is told by Frank Stryker , a Luckup executive, that San Miguel reneged on the deal after a distastrous and highly publicized demonstration of the Peacemaker. Muntz nevertheless decides to help Luckup re-sign San Miguel. He is joined by his partner, Ray Kasternak , an ex-fighter pilot now undergoing a religious crisis of conscience, and also by Catherine. Muntz's efforts are complicated by tensions with Luckup, by Ray's religious conversion, by \"The Peacemaker's\" many technical glitches and his own growing moral reservations. On the eve of a major defense industry exposition, Muntz is visited by Massagi , an immensely wealthy arms merchant who both encourages him to finalize the San Miguel deal and coaches him on how to do it. Massagi reveals that the global arms industry has a stake in sales of weapons like the Peacemaker because they allow for localized and conventional wars that will keep their business viable into the next century. Massagi also explains how recent changes to federal law not only legalize bribes to foreign dictators, but make those bribes tax deductible. These revelations spur Muntz on, while also adding to his unease. Muntz accompanies San Miguel's dictator to the weapons expo, where billions of dollars of high technology are displayed and demonstrated. To the dictators, Muntz disparages any warplanes he sees, reminding them of the obvious benefits of pilot-less aircraft. While Muntz demonstrates some of his own wares , Ray hijacks one of the fighter jets being demonstrated, threatening to attack the expo, also daring them to attack him. Ray circles overhead as representatives for defense contractors bicker among themselves as to whose weapons are good enough to shoot him down. Stryker takes matters into his own hands, launching the Peacemaker. This time, the UAV proves a much more formidable threat, and not even Ray can destroy it. Misusing all of the Peacemaker's weapons, however, Stryker instead destroys the entire expo. Before he can try again for Ray, Muntz uses his cane to shut off the Peacemaker's remote control panel, allowing Ray to destroy it. In the final scene, we learn that Ray has left the arms industry to become a missionary. Muntz is also out of weapons trafficking, but still a salesman working at his brother's car dealership.  He sells Catherine a car, and it's implied that they will be doing other deals together.\n",

            "In Rio Grande, Lt. Col. Kirby Yorke  is posted on the Texas frontier to defend settlers against depredations of marauding Apaches. Col. Yorke is under considerable stress between the Apaches using Mexico as a sanctuary from pursuit and by a serious shortage of troops of his command. The action of the movie is set in the summer of 1879 . Tension is added when Yorke's son , Trooper Jeff Yorke , is one of 18 recruits sent to the regiment. He has flunked out of West Point and immediately enlisted as a private in the Army. Not wanting to give any impression that he is showing favoritism towards his son, Col. Yorke ends up being harsher dealing with Jeff than the others. By his willingness to undergo any test and trial, Jeff is befriended by a pair of older recruits, Travis Tyree ([[Ben Johnson   and \"Sandy\" Boone , who take him under their wings. With the arrival of Yorke's estranged wife, Kathleen , who has come to take the under-age Yorke home with her, further tension is added. During the war, Yorke had been forced by circumstances to burn Bridesdale, his wife's plantation home in the Shenandoah valley. Sgt. Quincannon , who put the torch to Bridesdale, is still with Yorke and provides a constant reminder to Kathleen of the episode. In a showdown with his mother, Jeff refuses her attempt by reminding her that not only the commander's signature is required to discharge him, but his own as well, and he chooses to stay in the Army. The tension brought about in the struggle over their son's future  rekindles the romance the couple once felt for each other. Yorke is visited by his former Civil War commander, Philip Sheridan , now commanding general of his department. Sheridan has decided to order Yorke to cross the Rio Grande into Mexico in pursuit of the Apaches, an action with serious political implications since it violates the sovereignty of another nation. If Yorke fails in his mission to destroy the Apache threat he faces the threat of court-martial. Sheridan, in a quiet act of acknowledgment of what he is asking Yorke to risk, promises that the members of the court will be men \"who rode down the Shenandoah\" with them during the Civil War. Yorke accepts the mission. Now Col. Yorke must fight to save, and put back together, his family and his honor. Yorke leads his men toward Mexico, only to learn that a wagonload of children from his fort, who were being taken to Ft. Bliss for safety, has been captured by the Apaches. After permitting three troopers&mdash;Tyree, Boone, Jeff&mdash;to infiltrate the church in the Mexican village where the Indians have taken the children, Yorke leads his cavalry in a full-scale attack, rescuing all of the children unharmed but being wounded himself. He is taken back to the fort by his victorious troops, where Kathleen meets him and holds his hand as he is carried on a travois into the post as the movie closes.\n",

            "Stalag 17 begins on \"the longest night of the year\" in 1944 in a Luftwaffe prisoner-of-war camp located somewhere along the Danube River. The story of a Nazi spy in Barracks Four is narrated by Clarence Harvey \"Cookie\" Cook . The camp holds Poles, Czechs, Russian females and in the American compound 640 sergeants, enlisted men from bomber crews, gunners, radiomen and flight engineers. Prisoners of War Manfredi and Johnson try to escape through a tunnel the inmates have dug under the barbed wire. They are immediately shot by waiting prison guards when they emerge outside the fence. The other prisoners conclude that one of their own must have informed the Germans of the escape attempt, and suspicion falls on Sefton , a cynical and somewhat antisocial prisoner who barters openly with the German guards for eggs, silk stockings, blankets and other luxuries. He also organizes mouse races and various other profitable enterprises that net him his hoard of \"luxuries.\" The other prisoners are suspicious of his fraternization with the enemy, though envious of his dealmaking success — for instance, he wins a large number of cigarettes from the other prisoners by betting against Manfredi's and Johnson's successful escape, then trades the cigarettes to the Germans for an egg the next morning. Sefton's tells the men it is foolish to try to escape. He is not seeking \"fruit salad\"  He continues, \"what if you escape, make it back to the United States, they ship you to the Pacific, you're shot down again, this time you're in a Japanese Prison camp.\" The lives of the prisoners are depicted: they receive mail, eat terrible food, wash in the latrine sinks, and collectively do their best to keep sane and defy the camp's cruel and ruthless commandant, Oberst von Scherbach . They use a clandestine radio, smuggled from barracks to barracks throughout the entire camp, to pick up the BBC and the war news.  Their German guard, Feldwebel Schulz , confiscates the radio—another success for the \"stoolie\". Humor is seen in \"Animal\" Kasava's infatuation with movie actress, Betty Grable. He suffers from depression when he learns Betty has married bandleader Harry James. Harry \"Sugar Lips\" Shapiro gets six letters at mail call, and makes Animal think they are from women. When Kasava sees a finance company letterhead, Harry admits they repossessed his Plymouth. Sefton bribes the guards to let him spend the day in the women's barracks in the Russian section of the camp. The other prisoners spot him through Sefton's own telescope , and conclude that this is his reward for having informed the Germans about the radio. When he returns he is accused of being a spy. At that moment von Scherbach pays a visit to the barracks to apprehend new prisoner, Lieutenant James Schuyler Dunbar ([[Don Taylor , who had previously told the other prisoners that he had blown up a German ammunition train while he was being transported to the camp. Sefton knows Dunbar comes from a wealthy Boston family. Sefton washed out of pilot training in the class from which Dunbar graduated. Sefton feels Dunbar was commissioned because of his family's money. The men are convinced that Sefton divulged Dunbar's act of sabotage to the Germans, and they viciously beat Sefton, after which he is ostracized. Sefton then decides to investigate and uncover the identity of the spy in order to clear his name. Eventually he remains in the barracks during a fake air raid and successfully discovers the identity of the spy, the barracks security chief, Price ([[Peter Graves , whom Sefton overhears conversing with Schulz in German and divulging the means by which Dunbar destroyed the ammunition train. Sefton divulges the theory to his only friend in the camp, Cookie. He points out that the stoolie may not be an American traitor at all but a German spy posing as an American to ferret out information. If he exposes Price, and proves he is the real stoolie, the Germans would simply remove him and put him in another camp. On Christmas Day the men find out that SS men are coming to take Dunbar to Berlin for interrogation. The entire camp creates a distraction and Dunbar is freed and hidden. Nobody but the compound chief Hoffy  knows of Dunbar's whereabouts, and he refuses to divulge the information to anybody, even the supposedly trustworthy Price. Dunbar is thus successfully kept from the Germans despite extensive search efforts. After von Scherbach threatens to raze the camp to find Dunbar, the men decide one of them must help Dunbar escape. Price volunteers for the job, and when he appears to have convinced the other prisoners to let him do it, Sefton reveals him as the spy. After accusing Price, Sefton asks him \"When was Pearl Harbor?\" Price knows the date, but Sefton traps him by quickly asking what time he heard the news. Without thinking, Price betrays himself by answering 6 p.m. — the correct time of the attack in Berlin, Germany, and not Cleveland, Ohio where he claims to have come from. After that, Sefton reaches into Price's jacket pocket and extracts the \"mailbox\" used to exchange messages with the Germans, a hollowed-out black chess queen. With his fellow POWs convinced of Price's guilt, Sefton decides to take Dunbar out of the camp himself. First, because he likes the odds of escape, and second, for the reward he can expect from Dunbar's wealthy family. The men give Sefton enough time to get Dunbar out of his hiding place  then throw Price out into the yard with tin cans tied to his legs. The ruse works: Price is killed in a hail of bullets  by camp guards who believe him to be Dunbar or one of the other prisoners, creating a distraction that allows Sefton and Dunbar to cut through the barbed wire and make their escape. Everyone begins to wonder if Sefton or Dunbar will ever make it out of Germany alive. Animal says, \"Maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters. You ever think of that? \" The film ends with Cookie whistling \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again.\"\n",

Her older sister is an unwed mother living on welfare. Her older brother is a drug-dealing junkie. In the course of the film, Cynthia faces chaos and betrayal. One of her friends is deliberately murdered, while another of her loved ones is accidentally shot. She runs from the police at one point, and to them at another. But through it all, Cynthia has a secret friend: Anne Frank. In a flashback scene early in the film, Cynthia’s now-dead father gives his young daughter a dog-eared copy of The Diary Of Anne Frank and for the rest of the film Anne’s words, read verbatim by Cynthia, provide both her solace and her inspiration. Cynthia buys herself a plaid notebook that looks very much like Anne’s original, and she retreats to her corner, like Anne did, to record her private thoughts. “All children must look after their own upbringing,” she reads, and from these words she understands that she can either blame her surroundings and give up, or take responsibility for her own future. She finds out that her brother is selling her poems to a rapper named ‘Deuce’ who has been performing them and recording them and claiming them as his own. But with Anne’s voice in her head, Cynthia finds her courage, and by the end of the film she has transformed herself into an artist named “Anne B. Real.”\n",

            "William S. Bowdern  is a World War II veteran who was severely affected by a bad experience in France on All Saints’ Day in 1944. In the first scene of the movie, we flash-back through one of Bowdern's dreams to where he was trying to escape from a German advance as SS soldiers execute wounded American soldiers. A wounded soldier calls Bowdern, the chaplain, to give him the Last Rites; Bowdern at first denies him so he can escape. Bowdern rethinks the matter and does his duty but is bayonetted by an SS soldier. He becomes an alcoholic, tormented by his injuries and the guilt of refusing a dying man's last wish. Years later, Bowdern is teaching his students at St. Louis University  when, at the end of the lecture, an angry mob smashes the classroom's windows. When Bowdern gets out, he discovers that there is a demonstration against the school's recent racial integration. When the police arrive, he asks them to arrest \"those people\" &mdash; meaning the protestors &mdash; but the police arrest the black students instead. Angered, Bowdern physically attacks the cops, who arrest him as well. Father Raymond McBride  pays his bail, and drives him to the Alexian Brothers Hospital to show where the church places hopeless alcoholics and the mentally ill. Robbie Mannheim  is sitting with his aunt, Hanna , who is teaching him how to contact the ‘other world’. Robbie's mother  suddenly discovers the two at the Ouija board. She scolds at Aunt Hanna for disregarding her request that she not expose Robbie to such ideas. Robbie disobeys his mother's demands that he stay away from the supernatural, as he enjoys the contacts. When Aunt Hanna dies, Robbie continues trying to reach the other world. One day one of Robbie's classmates  during school is severely wounded in the hand when a desk falls on top of him. Robbie is blamed. Ultimately, he is expelled from school. His father  demands why Robbie hurt his classmate. When Robbie explains to his father that he did not deliberately do that and the desk moved itself, his father does not believe him. During their conversation, the chair on which Robbie is sitting moves out from under him, making Robbie crash to the floor. Robbie's parents feel someone or something is trying to harm their child. They feel he may really be ‘possessed’. They take him to the Lutheran Pastor Reverend Eckhardt ([[Richard Waugh , who understands what is happening to Robbie and takes him to his house to put him under exact monitoring . During Robbie's stay, several things occur that convince Pastor Eckhardt that Robbie is being afflicted by demons: strange noises are made in the house, the wall clock is smashed, and Robbie falls into fits of rage and hysteria. When Pastor Eckhardt tells his wife that Robbie should be treated by the Catholics, Robbie attacks him.  McBride visits the family in their house to check on Robbie after his parents go to the university requesting help. During one of Robbie's fits of hysteria, the parents find the letters SLU scrawled on his belly. When he enters his room, he is attacked and becomes convinced that the child is endowed with some sort of supernatural power, and convinces Bowdern to visit the family. Bowdern visits Robbie in his room, comforting him with his knowledge of comic books. Bowdern notices that Robbie is interested in magic and ventriliquism, while Robbie notices that Fr. Bowdern is affected by his collection of toy soldiers that sets off a post traumatic stress disorder event. When Father Bowdern tries to convince the parents that there is nothing wrong with Robbie, the boy suddenly becomes hysterical, speaking in Latin as things fly across the room. Bowdern becomes convinced that Robbie must undergo treatment. Bowdern and McBride go to Archbishop Hume  to persuade him to give Robbie an exorcism. The Archbishop is skeptical, saying that he is trying to improve the Catholic Church's public image as a modern institution, free of ancient superstition. He requests to speak to McBride alone, and he nominates Bowdern to handle the issue. Bowdern begins Robbie's treatment, assisted by McBride and Father Walter Halloran . They conduct several visits to him during which Robbie starts throwing temper tantrums. He scratches at them, vomits and urinates on them, and swears uncontrollably. During the treatment trials, Bowdern has flashbacks to his war experiences and dreads that this may be another failure. Robbie is transferred twice to two different churches. Finally, Bowdern manages to cure him. The room in the church where the exorcism takes place is locked on Archbishop Hume's orders.\n",

            "William S. Bowdern  is a World War II veteran who was severely affected by a bad experience in France on All Saints’ Day in 1944. In the first scene of the movie, we flash-back through one of Bowdern's dreams to where he was trying to escape from a German advance as SS soldiers execute wounded American soldiers. A wounded soldier calls Bowdern, the chaplain, to give him the Last Rites; Bowdern at first denies him so he can escape. Bowdern rethinks the matter and does his duty but is bayonetted by an SS soldier. He becomes an alcoholic, tormented by his injuries and the guilt of refusing a dying man's last wish. Years later, Bowdern is teaching his students at St. Louis University  when, at the end of the lecture, an angry mob smashes the classroom's windows. When Bowdern gets out, he discovers that there is a demonstration against the school's recent racial integration. When the police arrive, he asks them to arrest \"those people\" &mdash; meaning the protestors &mdash; but the police arrest the black students instead. Angered, Bowdern physically attacks the cops, who arrest him as well. Father Raymond McBride  pays his bail, and drives him to the Alexian Brothers Hospital to show where the church places hopeless alcoholics and the mentally ill. Robbie Mannheim  is sitting with his aunt, Hanna , who is teaching him how to contact the ‘other world’. Robbie's mother  suddenly discovers the two at the Ouija board. She scolds at Aunt Hanna for disregarding her request that she not expose Robbie to such ideas. Robbie disobeys his mother's demands that he stay away from the supernatural, as he enjoys the contacts. When Aunt Hanna dies, Robbie continues trying to reach the other world. One day one of Robbie's classmates  during school is severely wounded in the hand when a desk falls on top of him. Robbie is blamed. Ultimately, he is expelled from school. His father  demands why Robbie hurt his classmate. When Robbie explains to his father that he did not deliberately do that and the desk moved itself, his father does not believe him. During their conversation, the chair on which Robbie is sitting moves out from under him, making Robbie crash to the floor. Robbie's parents feel someone or something is trying to harm their child. They feel he may really be ‘possessed’. They take him to the Lutheran Pastor Reverend Eckhardt ([[Richard Waugh , who understands what is happening to Robbie and takes him to his house to put him under exact monitoring . During Robbie's stay, several things occur that convince Pastor Eckhardt that Robbie is being afflicted by demons: strange noises are made in the house, the wall clock is smashed, and Robbie falls into fits of rage and hysteria. When Pastor Eckhardt tells his wife that Robbie should be treated by the Catholics, Robbie attacks him.  McBride visits the family in their house to check on Robbie after his parents go to the university requesting help. During one of Robbie's fits of hysteria, the parents find the letters SLU scrawled on his belly. When he enters his room, he is attacked and becomes convinced that the child is endowed with some sort of supernatural power, and convinces Bowdern to visit the family. Bowdern visits Robbie in his room, comforting him with his knowledge of comic books. Bowdern notices that Robbie is interested in magic and ventriliquism, while Robbie notices that Fr. Bowdern is affected by his collection of toy soldiers that sets off a post traumatic stress disorder event. When Father Bowdern tries to convince the parents that there is nothing wrong with Robbie, the boy suddenly becomes hysterical, speaking in Latin as things fly across the room. Bowdern becomes convinced that Robbie must undergo treatment. Bowdern and McBride go to Archbishop Hume  to persuade him to give Robbie an exorcism. The Archbishop is skeptical, saying that he is trying to improve the Catholic Church's public image as a modern institution, free of ancient superstition. He requests to speak to McBride alone, and he nominates Bowdern to handle the issue. Bowdern begins Robbie's treatment, assisted by McBride and Father Walter Halloran . They conduct several visits to him during which Robbie starts throwing temper tantrums. He scratches at them, vomits and urinates on them, and swears uncontrollably. During the treatment trials, Bowdern has flashbacks to his war experiences and dreads that this may be another failure. Robbie is transferred twice to two different churches. Finally, Bowdern manages to cure him. The room in the church where the exorcism takes place is locked on Archbishop Hume's orders.\n",

To reduce the chance that he would be sent to Auschwitz or a similar fate, his parents send him to live with a farm family, the elderly parents of Catholic friends of his parents.  The elderly couple honestly think that the boy has been sent to live with them because Paris is dangerous; it never crosses their mind that Claude is a Jew. Claude is given a new last name , is taught a few things about Catholic ritual, such as the Lord's Prayer, and most important, is told to never let anyone see his circumcised penis ; thus Claude's strange prudishness at bath time. Otherwise, he plays well the part of boy grateful to be safe in the countryside, building a warm relationship with Pepe  and Meme , his simple and likeable surrogate grandparents. They form a strong and mutually affectionate bond. There is a fly in the ointment; Claude’s willing protectors share in the prejudices common to their time and place, anti-Semitism included. They believe World War II to be the fault of Jews, communists, Freemasons, and worst of all, the British who can never be trusted. Pepe even considers Marshal Philippe Pétain, the puppet ruling France under Germany’s thumb, a hero. Pepe attempts to pass his anti-Semitic convictions on to the boy. The boy plays along with the old man, teasing him about his prejudices but never revealing the truth about himself.\n",

A female teacher arrives in town to teach women how to paint. She uses the young boy as a model and then as a toy for her pleasure. The teacher subsequently takes another lover and abandons the young man, claiming that she was unaware of his marriage. The young boy eventually kills his wife, but his father takes the blame for the crime and confesses his sins before he dies in prison. As a conclusion to this sad movie, the townspeople punish the young boy for what he has done. Typical \"film noire\"See, e.g., Biesen , p. 1; Hirsch , p. 9; Lyons , p. 2; Silver and Ward , p. 1; Schatz , p. 112. Outside the field of noir scholarship, \"dark film\" is also offered on occasion; see, e.g., Block, Bruce A., The Visual Story: Seeing the Structure of Film, TV, and New Media , p. 94; Klarer, Mario, An Introduction to Literary Studies , p. 59. plot of the film is not the main message of the film. The film is about fighting good against evil, and how criticism of government by Petrović reached another level as battle between good, in the character of mentally challenged Goca, and evil, in most of the characters in the film. Other themes that run through the movie are: selfishness, prudence, jealousy, rejection of right values, and the decline of society. The end of the movie shows how easy evil can be spread and infect people who are in touch with it.\n",

He is perceived as a good for nothing person as he skips classes, fails in exams, and gets involved in fights. Kadhir believes that his father hates him and often quarrels with him, even threatening to leave the house, only to be persuaded not to do so by his mother. Kadhir's life changes when a Hindi speaking North Indian family moves into the same colony. Kadhir finds himself attracted to the daughter of that family, Anita . Although he tries to woo her, Anita treats him with disdain. Kadhir confesses to Anita that he loves her. He tells her that having always been ridiculed, he found respite in the fact that she at least cared to look at him. He promises to wipe her thoughts out of his mind, as he is not right for her. Despite himself, Kadhir continues pursuing her. Anita realizes that Kadhir is not such a useless fellow when his best friend tells her that he can dismantle and assemble a motorcycle within minutes. She takes Kadhir to a Hero Honda dealer and asks them to offer him a job. He is promised a job if he can assemble a bike. Initially, Kadhir is disinterested and gives up the task.

Anita's parents want Anita to marry the son of the family who has helped them. Anita escapes her home and meets Kadhir and they end up in a hotel room.

Arbutny  and charming and erudite drunkard Johnny West  to her London flat on Chinese New Year in 1938 because of her belief that if three strangers make the same wish to an idol of Kwan Yin, Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny, the wish will be granted. Since money will make their dreams come true, the three go in on a sweepstakes ticket for the Grand National horse race together and agree that they will not sell the ticket if it is chosen, but will hold onto it until the race is run. Shackelford would use the money to try to win her estranged husband back, Arbutny to smooth the way for his selection to the prestigious Barrister's Club, and Johnny to buy a bar and live in it. The stories of the three strangers are revealed. Shackelford's husband David  moved to Canada and fell in love with Janet Elliot . He returns, just after Johnny and Arbutny take their leave of Crystal, and demands a divorce, but she refuses. She sees to it that he loses a promotion. She also lies to Janet, telling her that David still loves her and that she is pregnant. The trusting woman believes her and returns to Canada. With the help of an adoring Icey Crane , Johnny has been hiding out after his drunken participation in a botched robbery that resulted in the death of a policeman. Icey commits perjury in order to provide an alibi for the murderer and ringleader, Bertram Fallon . When a second witness is discredited, Fallon confesses to the robbery but blames the murder on West and the third man involved, Gabby . Johnny is caught and sentenced to death, but Gabby finds Fallon on his way to prison and stabs him. On his deathbed, Fallon clears Johnny. Arbutny has been speculating in stocks with money from the trust fund of Lady Rhea Belladon , an eccentric widow who believe she can talk with her dead husband. When the stock falls and his margin is called, a desperate Arbutny proposes to Lady Belladon. After consulting with her dead husband, she turns him down. Worse, she says that Lord Belladon wants to have the books checked. Arbutny is about to shoot himself when he sees in a newspaper that the sweepstakes ticket has drawn the favorite in the Grand National. The three strangers converge on Crystal's flat. Arbutny wants to sell his share of the ticket immediately so he can replace the funds he stole before his crime can be uncovered. Johnny is willing, but Shackelford is adamant that they stick to their original agreement. Arbutny becomes enraged and kills her with her statue of Kwan Yin. He then panics and runs out into the middle of the busy street, where he is struck down by a car, but not fatally. When the police arrive, he confesses the murder to them. Ironically, their horse wins. However, Johnny realizes that the winning ticket has to be destroyed because their signatures are on it; the money would be seen as a motive for murder. They leave, but the guilt-ridden Arbutny confesses in public what he has done. Johnny returns to the pub, where Icey finds him. Content with her, he sets the ticket on fire.\n",

When he returns home Francoise is preparing for a dinner party she is giving that night. Paul asks her where she has been all day and if she knew what happened to at the theater. She replied that she did' He asked he if she lost anything while she was out and shows her the gun. With a glassy stare she tells him, \"I never travel with firearms\". At the dinner party, the topic of crimes of passion comes up and Francoise defends a woman's right to commit a crime of passion because the parties who have wronged her have killed her first. After the dinner, he confronts her and calls her a fiend. She tells him that she intends not to say anything and at first he threatens to turn her in to the police. Instead he tells Francoise that he will stay and keep her secret to watch her fall apart. He moves out of the bedroom. Two months pass and Paul notes in his diary that Francoise still has not turned herself in but instead exhibits a cool unemotional exterior. At dinner she tells Paul that she intend to leave him and travel. Odette's dog is brought to Paul while they are at dinner and Paul decides to keep him since he has no home. The dog's presence makes Francoise uneasy. Francoise reads Paul's diary and in the last entry he says that even if she travels her feelings of guilt will follow her. The last line says that he is unable to feel sorry for her. Francoise puts a line though that last line and underneath writes, \"I am staying\". Francoise unexpectedly shows up at a party Paul is throwing for the 100th performance of his play, the party is being held on the stage. He had just finished telling everyone that she wasn't coming because she was feeling unwell. The rest if the crowd seems pleased to see her but when she sits and the table offers a toast to her, Paul remains silent. As she sits at the table, A young actor who is drunk, flirts with her and forces her out into the dance floor for a dance. Francoise keeps seeing the shooting over and over again and leaves the room. Paul notes in his diary that Francoise is rapidly becoming weighed down by her guilt. By now she is looking very ill and tired but refuses to allow Paul to call a doctor for her. He receives a letter that at first he refuses to read to her. When she demands he read it, she finds out that the bank robber has been convicted of Odette's murder and sentenced to death. Francoise goes to her friend, the district attorney and asks for permission to see the Castelli , condemned man. He is hostile to her when she is let into his cell. She confesses to him that she murdered Odette. He tells her that she should go away and to never mention it again, he would have been executed for killing the bank teller anyway. He sees it as a joke, the authorities are going to execute him for a crime he truly did not commit. It is six month later and Paul tells Francoise that she is the only person suffering more than him but as long as she won't confess, she will continue to die inside. At dinner that night, she sees a paper where Castelli confessed to killing Odette just before being hanged. While she is unconscious her mind plays though all of the events of the past six months. When she wakes up, Paul tells her that she is the only person who can help herself. After a moment's pause, she picks up the phone and makes an appointment to see the attorney general to turn herself in for the murder. Paul says that he will stand by her throughout her upcoming ordeal. She declines his offer but asks that he comes to visit her in jail occasionally. He helps her dress and once more she tells him to remain as she leaves to make her way to confess to the murder. As she walks, along, Paul is walking a distance behind her. A boy runs into the street after a ball. He falls as a truck is bearing down on him. Francoise jumps into the street to save him and sustains a critical head injury. The doctor gives Paul the good news that while Francoise will live, she has lost her memory of her entire life and how to do basic functions such as feeding herself, their names and her entire life history. This includes her murder and subsequent guilt. The final scene shows that Paul has taken Francoise to the south of France to recuperate, She is repeating simple words such as \"sand\" and \"mountain\" and he is taking care of her, convinced that this is God's plan.\n",

            "Crystal Shackelford  lures two strangers, solicitor Jerome K. Arbutny  and charming and erudite drunkard Johnny West  to her London flat on Chinese New Year in 1938 because of her belief that if three strangers make the same wish to an idol of Kwan Yin, Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny, the wish will be granted. Since money will make their dreams come true, the three go in on a sweepstakes ticket for the Grand National horse race together and agree that they will not sell the ticket if it is chosen, but will hold onto it until the race is run. Shackelford would use the money to try to win her estranged husband back, Arbutny to smooth the way for his selection to the prestigious Barrister's Club, and Johnny to buy a bar and live in it. The stories of the three strangers are revealed. Shackelford's husband David  moved to Canada and fell in love with Janet Elliot . He returns, just after Johnny and Arbutny take their leave of Crystal, and demands a divorce, but she refuses. She sees to it that he loses a promotion. She also lies to Janet, telling her that David still loves her and that she is pregnant. The trusting woman believes her and returns to Canada. With the help of an adoring Icey Crane , Johnny has been hiding out after his drunken participation in a botched robbery that resulted in the death of a policeman. Icey commits perjury in order to provide an alibi for the murderer and ringleader, Bertram Fallon . When a second witness is discredited, Fallon confesses to the robbery but blames the murder on West and the third man involved, Gabby . Johnny is caught and sentenced to death, but Gabby finds Fallon on his way to prison and stabs him. On his deathbed, Fallon clears Johnny. Arbutny has been speculating in stocks with money from the trust fund of Lady Rhea Belladon , an eccentric widow who believe she can talk with her dead husband. When the stock falls and his margin is called, a desperate Arbutny proposes to Lady Belladon. After consulting with her dead husband, she turns him down. Worse, she says that Lord Belladon wants to have the books checked. Arbutny is about to shoot himself when he sees in a newspaper that the sweepstakes ticket has drawn the favorite in the Grand National. The three strangers converge on Crystal's flat. Arbutny wants to sell his share of the ticket immediately so he can replace the funds he stole before his crime can be uncovered. Johnny is willing, but Shackelford is adamant that they stick to their original agreement. Arbutny becomes enraged and kills her with her statue of Kwan Yin. He then panics and runs out into the middle of the busy street, where he is struck down by a car, but not fatally. When the police arrive, he confesses the murder to them. Ironically, their horse wins. However, Johnny realizes that the winning ticket has to be destroyed because their signatures are on it; the money would be seen as a motive for murder. They leave, but the guilt-ridden Arbutny confesses in public what he has done. Johnny returns to the pub, where Icey finds him. Content with her, he sets the ticket on fire.\n",

            "After ten years of marriage, New York millionaire socialite couple Brad  and Caroline Sexton  are miserable and have decided to call it quits. Their marital problems come to a head earlier that evening when Brad turns their 10th anniversary party into a real estate development pitch for a theme park he calls \"The Holy Land\", modeled after Biblical lore. The pitch turns disastrous when one of the display's special effects catches a guest's  dress on fire. At the same time, Brad's accountant, Bob Lachman , is up to his own tricks, making the Sextons' millions disappear into his own pocket mostly through mismanagement and filing false tax returns. His money manipulation has caught the attention of the Internal Revenue Service , and field agent Frank Hall , demands to meet Bob and Brad the following morning to bring the obligations up to date...to the tune of $5,000,000. Bob arrives at the office early the following morning with a file box  and an agenda...leave before Brad arrives. Though he doesn't get out in time, he manages to finally evade Brad...and Hall, who has just shown up. Hearing a hint from Bob that the Sextons could be fleeing , Hall orders the freezing of all their assets. Brad is unable to access his money through an ATM and Caroline has her credit card destroyed at her table as she's having lunch with some friends. Brad is then informed that his accounts have been frozen, but the bank teller refuses to tell him why. He then gets Bob on the phone, who tells him that he himself is the cause of their newfound problems as he's headed for the airport. IRS Inspector Derek Lester ([[Larry Miller  loves his job  and joins Hall to serve the warrant and bring in the Sextons. As Brad exits the bank , Hall and Lester surround him at a bull statue on Wall Street. Brad takes out his new satellite phone to answer a call, but the trigger-happy Lester mistakes it for a gun and pulls out his own pistol, shooting it out of Brad's hand, much to Hall's chagrin. Brad flees on foot, steals a cab and happens to pick up Caroline. The Sextons get away from Hall and Lester and the NYPD  and leave New York. They crash the cab and find themselves in Intercourse, Pennsylvania; a small Lancaster-area community of Old Order Amish. Brad drops in on a conversation and after stealing some clothes, they masquerade as Jacob and Emma Yoder, a family's  expected cousins from Missouri. Samuel and Levinia , along with their sons and daughters, make the pair at home. The pair try to fit in, and while Brad manages to adjust well, the prima donna Caroline, deprived of cigarettes and creature comforts, throws various childlike tantrums when she and Brad are alone. Gradually, both learn to fit in through their own abilities. Brad with his knowledge of real estate values, helps Samuel's future son-in-law Henner buy a plot of land, and Caroline's knowledge of fashion helps their conservative ordnung relax their colorless dress code. The Sextons then rediscover why they fell in love in the first place, largely through their efforts of helping others rather than themselves. As Samuel and Levinia's daughter Rebecca is exchanging vows with Henner, the ceremony is interrupted by police and a drenched Hall and Lester, who crashed into the stolen cab. The Sextons are exposed and hauled back to New York to face trial. Brad's attorney Phil Kleinmann ([[Michael Lerner  informs them that he found Bob in Zurich and had him extradited back to America. A resisting Bob is then hauled into the courtroom by uniformed officers to face the Sextons. Brad thanks Bob for, in a way, saving their marriage, but doesn't forgive him and decks him. Charges against the Sextons are dropped. Brad and Caroline return to the Yoders to make things right, but their pleas for forgiveness seem to fall on deaf ears. As they're turning to leave, Samuel informs them that he and Levinia knew the whole time of the ruse. They said they put up with it because it was planting season and they needed the extra help. Brad offers to give his watch as a present only to be told that their Amish cannot accept gifts only trades. He then proceeds to trade the watch for Big John, a gargantuan Belgian horse that Brad  tamed largely by dumb luck, and some corn. Brad also tells Sam that maybe he should not open the back of the watch; the watch seems to have in it a risque picture which amuses him. The movie ends with Brad and Caroline driving a 1954 Ford pickup with a horse trailer hauling Big John. It's then revealed that the Sextons traded their 1997 Jaguar for the truck. In the closing credits, Brad contemplates buying the pond, where they crashed the cab and Caroline reveals she is pregnant with the couple's first child.\n",

            "Crystal Shackelford  lures two strangers, solicitor Jerome K. Arbutny  and charming and erudite drunkard Johnny West  to her London flat on Chinese New Year in 1938 because of her belief that if three strangers make the same wish to an idol of Kwan Yin, Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny, the wish will be granted. Since money will make their dreams come true, the three go in on a sweepstakes ticket for the Grand National horse race together and agree that they will not sell the ticket if it is chosen, but will hold onto it until the race is run. Shackelford would use the money to try to win her estranged husband back, Arbutny to smooth the way for his selection to the prestigious Barrister's Club, and Johnny to buy a bar and live in it. The stories of the three strangers are revealed. Shackelford's husband David  moved to Canada and fell in love with Janet Elliot . He returns, just after Johnny and Arbutny take their leave of Crystal, and demands a divorce, but she refuses. She sees to it that he loses a promotion. She also lies to Janet, telling her that David still loves her and that she is pregnant. The trusting woman believes her and returns to Canada. With the help of an adoring Icey Crane , Johnny has been hiding out after his drunken participation in a botched robbery that resulted in the death of a policeman. Icey commits perjury in order to provide an alibi for the murderer and ringleader, Bertram Fallon . When a second witness is discredited, Fallon confesses to the robbery but blames the murder on West and the third man involved, Gabby . Johnny is caught and sentenced to death, but Gabby finds Fallon on his way to prison and stabs him. On his deathbed, Fallon clears Johnny. Arbutny has been speculating in stocks with money from the trust fund of Lady Rhea Belladon , an eccentric widow who believe she can talk with her dead husband. When the stock falls and his margin is called, a desperate Arbutny proposes to Lady Belladon. After consulting with her dead husband, she turns him down. Worse, she says that Lord Belladon wants to have the books checked. Arbutny is about to shoot himself when he sees in a newspaper that the sweepstakes ticket has drawn the favorite in the Grand National. The three strangers converge on Crystal's flat. Arbutny wants to sell his share of the ticket immediately so he can replace the funds he stole before his crime can be uncovered. Johnny is willing, but Shackelford is adamant that they stick to their original agreement. Arbutny becomes enraged and kills her with her statue of Kwan Yin. He then panics and runs out into the middle of the busy street, where he is struck down by a car, but not fatally. When the police arrive, he confesses the murder to them. Ironically, their horse wins. However, Johnny realizes that the winning ticket has to be destroyed because their signatures are on it; the money would be seen as a motive for murder. They leave, but the guilt-ridden Arbutny confesses in public what he has done. Johnny returns to the pub, where Icey finds him. Content with her, he sets the ticket on fire.\n",

            "After ten years of marriage, New York millionaire socialite couple Brad  and Caroline Sexton  are miserable and have decided to call it quits. Their marital problems come to a head earlier that evening when Brad turns their 10th anniversary party into a real estate development pitch for a theme park he calls \"The Holy Land\", modeled after Biblical lore. The pitch turns disastrous when one of the display's special effects catches a guest's  dress on fire. At the same time, Brad's accountant, Bob Lachman , is up to his own tricks, making the Sextons' millions disappear into his own pocket mostly through mismanagement and filing false tax returns. His money manipulation has caught the attention of the Internal Revenue Service , and field agent Frank Hall , demands to meet Bob and Brad the following morning to bring the obligations up to date...to the tune of $5,000,000. Bob arrives at the office early the following morning with a file box  and an agenda...leave before Brad arrives. Though he doesn't get out in time, he manages to finally evade Brad...and Hall, who has just shown up. Hearing a hint from Bob that the Sextons could be fleeing , Hall orders the freezing of all their assets. Brad is unable to access his money through an ATM and Caroline has her credit card destroyed at her table as she's having lunch with some friends. Brad is then informed that his accounts have been frozen, but the bank teller refuses to tell him why. He then gets Bob on the phone, who tells him that he himself is the cause of their newfound problems as he's headed for the airport. IRS Inspector Derek Lester ([[Larry Miller  loves his job  and joins Hall to serve the warrant and bring in the Sextons. As Brad exits the bank , Hall and Lester surround him at a bull statue on Wall Street. Brad takes out his new satellite phone to answer a call, but the trigger-happy Lester mistakes it for a gun and pulls out his own pistol, shooting it out of Brad's hand, much to Hall's chagrin. Brad flees on foot, steals a cab and happens to pick up Caroline. The Sextons get away from Hall and Lester and the NYPD  and leave New York. They crash the cab and find themselves in Intercourse, Pennsylvania; a small Lancaster-area community of Old Order Amish. Brad drops in on a conversation and after stealing some clothes, they masquerade as Jacob and Emma Yoder, a family's  expected cousins from Missouri. Samuel and Levinia , along with their sons and daughters, make the pair at home. The pair try to fit in, and while Brad manages to adjust well, the prima donna Caroline, deprived of cigarettes and creature comforts, throws various childlike tantrums when she and Brad are alone. Gradually, both learn to fit in through their own abilities. Brad with his knowledge of real estate values, helps Samuel's future son-in-law Henner buy a plot of land, and Caroline's knowledge of fashion helps their conservative ordnung relax their colorless dress code. The Sextons then rediscover why they fell in love in the first place, largely through their efforts of helping others rather than themselves. As Samuel and Levinia's daughter Rebecca is exchanging vows with Henner, the ceremony is interrupted by police and a drenched Hall and Lester, who crashed into the stolen cab. The Sextons are exposed and hauled back to New York to face trial. Brad's attorney Phil Kleinmann ([[Michael Lerner  informs them that he found Bob in Zurich and had him extradited back to America. A resisting Bob is then hauled into the courtroom by uniformed officers to face the Sextons. Brad thanks Bob for, in a way, saving their marriage, but doesn't forgive him and decks him. Charges against the Sextons are dropped. Brad and Caroline return to the Yoders to make things right, but their pleas for forgiveness seem to fall on deaf ears. As they're turning to leave, Samuel informs them that he and Levinia knew the whole time of the ruse. They said they put up with it because it was planting season and they needed the extra help. Brad offers to give his watch as a present only to be told that their Amish cannot accept gifts only trades. He then proceeds to trade the watch for Big John, a gargantuan Belgian horse that Brad  tamed largely by dumb luck, and some corn. Brad also tells Sam that maybe he should not open the back of the watch; the watch seems to have in it a risque picture which amuses him. The movie ends with Brad and Caroline driving a 1954 Ford pickup with a horse trailer hauling Big John. It's then revealed that the Sextons traded their 1997 Jaguar for the truck. In the closing credits, Brad contemplates buying the pond, where they crashed the cab and Caroline reveals she is pregnant with the couple's first child.\n",

            "The film opens with fast-talking businessman and diamond dealer Kyle Miller  speaking to a client over the phone as he returns to his lavish mansion home, his wife Sarah  and his teenage daughter Avery . Despite the charming facade, it is immediately clear that the family is dysfunctional and emotionally distant: Avery disrespects her parents and, despite being forbidden to do so, sneaks out of the house to go to a party with her friend Kendra. Sarah appears bored with life as a housewife and yearns for more in her marriage while Kyle seems to harbor a hidden aversion towards his wife. Just as Kyle is about to leave for a business transaction, the house is suddenly invaded by a gang of robbers masquerading as police. The thieves, consisting of leader Elias , his stripper girlfriend Petal , his younger brother Jonah , and a large intimidating man named Ty , tell Kyle and Sarah that they have been spying on them for some time and are aware of the large amounts of cash and diamonds hidden in their home. They demand Kyle to open a safe hidden in the wall but, despite a threat to utilize a syringe containing lethal injection chemicals, he defiantly refuses, believing that he and Sarah would be killed if he simply gave into their demands. Sarah, meanwhile, recognizes Jonah through his mask. Through a series of Jonah's flashbacks and a conversation with Elias, it is strongly implied that Sarah and Jonah had a previous affair when the latter was employed as a technician to install the house's security system. Unbeknownst to Elias, Sarah secretly steals the syringe from him during this conversation. Having left her party in disgust , Avery returns home and, after a brief chase, is also captured and taken to her parents. Elias appeals to Kyle, claiming that he needs money to pay for a kidney transplantation for his dying mother and that, if Kyle refuses to comply, he will instead take one of Avery's kidneys. Sarah catches Elias off-guard and holds him hostage with the syringe. Forced into a Mexican standoff, the thieves compromise by letting Avery escape in exchange for Kyle opening the safe. He does so, revealing it to be completely empty. Kyle explains that he is actually bankrupt and has no money; his house and all of his possessions were bought on loaned credit. Enraged, Elias breaks Kyle's hand and instead demands material compensation by taking Sarah's prized diamond necklace. However, Kyle reveals that this too is a fake cubic zirconia replica and is completely worthless. Ty recaptures Avery from outside and brings her back into the house. Kyle volunteers for his own kidney to be taken instead of his daughter's, but Elias reveals that it was a ploy and that he hated his mother, who is already dead. Ty grows impatient after receiving a phone call and commands Elias to hurry up; Kyle realizes that the burglars are themselves being coerced into committing the heist against their will. The thieves then separate the Miller family, with Kyle and Avery being tied up and guarded in the living room and Sarah being pursued by Jonah in the kitchen. Jonah states to Sarah that he still loves her and promises that she and Avery will be left unhurt. Meanwhile, Kyle uses a lighter to burn both his own and Avery's binds; they attempt an escape and set off the house's security system. Kyle ends up in a struggle with Ty, and, despite Ty's superior strength and fighting skills, Kyle manages to inject a portion of the syringe chemicals into his arm, causing him to fall unconscious. Thinking that Ty is dead, Elias shoots Kyle in the leg and reveals his true motives: that he is a drug dealer working for an organized crime syndicate. Shortly after being given a job to sell $180,000 worth of cocaine, Elias and Petal were carjacked at gunpoint and all of their shipments were promptly stolen. Faced with threats of retribution, Elias was then forced to commit a heist  to pay off his debt. Jonah, who had previously seen the Miller's residence, suggested it as a place to rob. Avery attempts to run out of the house again but is caught by Jonah. Under the threat of her parents being killed, she is forced to answer a call from the security company and successfully convinces them to call off the police. However a security guard  shows up nevertheless, with Sarah ordered to make him leave, but the security guard catches sight of Jonah and recognises him as a colleague, prompting Jonah to shoot him in the head. Kyle reveals to Elias that the only thing of any worth on him is his life insurance. Desperate and out of options, Elias kicks Kyle down and prepares to kill him. At the last second, Avery remembers the money she saw at the earlier party and pleads with the thieves that she can help them steal it from the party if they spare her father's life. Elias reluctantly agrees to the proposition and sends Petal to supervise Avery as she drives to the party house and ensure that she keeps her word . Although Avery's initial idea is to seduce Jake and then steal his money, she is horrified when Petal begins to deliriously proclaim that she plans to massacre all of the party guests and then take the cash. Seeing a swerving road ahead, Avery accelerates the car, unbuckles Petal's seat belt, and intentionally crashes into a telephone pole, incapacitating Petal and allowing Avery to handcuff Petal to the steering wheel. Back at the Miller home, Sarah learns that Kyle had discovered a picture of her kissing Jonah from security footage and was suspicious for some time that she had been unfaithful. Sarah, however, insists that she is innocent and only loves Kyle: the same flashback is now shown from her perspective, revealing that Jonah is in fact mentally ill  and that the supposed love affair between him and Sarah was all in his head. The \"kiss\" had occurred to Sarah's complete surprise and against her will. At this point, Ty reawakens from his stupor and attacks Sarah. Enraged, Jonah tackles Ty and the two fight. Just as Ty is about to strangle Jonah to death, Elias shoots him in the back for trying to kill his brother. However, in his dying breath, Ty reveals to Elias that he had been set up all along: the \"robbers\" stealing his cocaine shipment were actually fellow members of the same crime organization and the operation was done in order to blackmail him into stealing more money for them. More damningly, Ty also claims that Jonah had masterminded the entire plan so he could have an excuse to return to the Miller residence and profess his love to Sarah. Elias is shocked by the allegations but refuses to believe them. Through the chaos, Sarah and a wounded Kyle escape to the tool shed behind the house and are pursued by Elias and Jonah. After a brief fight, the thieves discover a large amount of money hidden inside the shed; Kyle reveals that he had sold Sarah's real diamond necklace and was saving the money as a nest egg for his family. As Elias and Jonah begin to collect the cash, Avery appears  and points a gun at them. Elias calls her bluff and aims his gun at Sarah but he is shot and killed by Jonah for this. Jonah tries again to convince Sarah that she belongs with him but she rebuffs his offers, calling him insane. In an attempt to sacrifice himself, Kyle tells his wife and daughter to run while setting the money in the tool shed on fire. He also shoots Jonah's foot with a nail gun, trapping him in the shed. While Avery goes to call the police, Sarah tries to help Kyle but she is grabbed in a last-ditch effort by Jonah, who is convinced that it is destiny for her to die together with him in the fire. However, Kyle then shoots him in the neck, causing him to fall and become engulfed in the flames. Sarah then carries Kyle away to safety just as the shed collapses. In the backyard, Kyle tries to tell Sarah to let him die so that she and Avery can survive on his life insurance fund but she refuses, stating that she loves him regardless of whether he has money or not. Avery runs back to her parents announcing that help is finally on the way. The three family members embrace as the real police arrive and surround the house.\n",

            "The year is 1936. The film is narrated by Wallau ([[Ray Collins .Seven prisoners escape from the fictitious Westhofen concentration camp near Worms, Germany near the Rhine. They represent a cross-section of German society: a writer, a circus performer, a schoolmaster, a farmer, a Jewish grocery clerk, and two prisoners who are apparently political activists. One is George Heisler  and the other his mentor Wallau , the leader of the group. The camp commandant erects a row of seven crosses and vows to \"put a man on each.\" The first to be apprehended is Wallau, who dies without giving up any information yet continues to narrate the film. The film follows Heisler as he makes his way across the German countryside , steals a jacket to cover his prison garb, and watches out, as the Nazis round up every other escaped prisoner and puts them up on the crosses, and the local population remains largely indifferent. Despite the common brutality of some of his countrymen, Heisler does receive help. Still, he is somewhat soured on the German people and humanity in general. He first makes his way to his home city of Mainz where his former girl friend, Leni, who had promised to wait for him, but has since married, refuses to help him in the slightest way, and threatens to \"report\" him; he steals a bit of her food and departs. He next witnesses the suicide leap of the cornered circus performer and then goes on to see a contact whose name he had given him, where he encounters Mme. Marelli  who gives him the outfit she was holding for the performer and slips some money into his coat pocket. Next he goes to a Jewish doctor a few doors away who had been suggested by Mme. Marelli, who treats a hand injured during his escape which had become infected. Intercut with Heisler's escape odyssey are some scenes involving some of his friends who are trying to locate and help him. When he finally reaches the home of his pre-arranged contact he finds that he has been arrested. He cannot visit his family, because they are being watched, so he goes to his old friend, Paul Roeder . Though Paul is a factory worker with a wife, Liesl , and young children, he still risks all to help Heisler. Roeder gets in touch with the German underground, whose members risk their lives to get Heisler out of the country. Through his exposure to this courage and kindness, and with the help toward the end of a sympathetic waitress  in an inn where he's hiding out and with whom he has a brief tryst and promises to send for later, Heisler regains his faith in humanity. Thanks to their help, the film ends as he approaches a cargo ship that is to take him away, \"perhaps to Holland\", with a shot of the empty seventh cross.\n",

They were founded as a refuge from the wars of Earth, but the vision died when the colonies began fighting a hundred-year war, reducing their once mighty cities to rubble. The stone walled city of Brecca is the northern neighbor of the nation of Obsidian, a culture of black glass cities and unfathomable technology. The war drags on with the vestiges of once mighty technologies, and the great armies are now but orphaned teenagers, fighting and dying for a cause they never knew. Unless the war ends, yet another entire generation of children on both sides will perish in battle, so Brecca’s greatest military leader, General Murren , decides to use the last of Brecca’s ancient weapons to end the war. It is called Warhammer, a hundred-year-old weapon built to cripple Obsidian’s technology using a technology more like magic than science. Murren leads a small team to deliver the weapon to Obsidian, taking with him his most loyal soldier, Sutherland  and Abel , a beautiful woman who is the last master of the ancient weapon. Feared by even her own people, Abel uses her ancient skills to channel energy into lethal forms. Murren also selects Evans , a celebrated warrior with a mysterious past, who has learned that peace is greater than victory. The small team intends to penetrate the defenses of an enemy city that couldn't be reached by Murren's father and six million men, but as the team battles its way toward Obsidian, they also must contend with their own Breccan people, torn apart by a century of conflict.\n",

            "The film opens with Alexander  stealing a chemical weapon from a military base. The weapon causes an enemy’s troops to lose the will to fight, thereby making conquest in battle far easier. This is part of Alexander’s dual goal: to conquer the world in the manner of Alexander the Great and to break each of the major moral codes in so doing . U.N.C.L.E. becomes involved after the theft of the weapon and agents Napoleon Solo  and Illya Kuryakin  are assigned. Also searching for Alexander is his estranged wife Tracey , although her motive is to serve him with divorce papers that will allow her to get $1,000,000 she put into the marriage. Through a series of coincidences , Solo, Kuryakin, and Tracey end up joining forces. As a result they are at various times captured, tortured, left to die in an elaborate way in an Egyptian tomb, and otherwise thwarted by Alexander throughout the film. Alexander believes that if he is able to assist a military junta in the takeover of a small country that he can use that country as a base for world conquest. By careful planning, he combines his final violation of a commandment - killing the country’s leader - with the takeover of the country and the start of his march toward global domination. Intervention by U.N.C.L.E. prevents the assassination, and during his escape Alexander is killed by his own accomplice Kavon .\n",

            "The story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when World War II was at its height. The cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, have a problem: the Nazi U-boats have changed one of their code reference books used for Enigma machine ciphers, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval signals intelligence. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the \"Shark\" cipher once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations. The film begins with Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with Claire. Jericho immediately tries to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire's housemate Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire. Mr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an MI5 agent, Wigram , who plays cat and mouse with him throughout the film. Meanwhile U-Boats closing in on one of the ship convoys from America allow Jericho and the team to work on breaking back into reading Shark. Jericho and Hester's research uncovers the British government's cover-up of the Katyn Massacre for fear knowledge of it might weaken American willingness to remain in the war on the same side as Joseph Stalin. Cryptanalyst Jozef 'Puck' Pukowski , working at the Park, learned of Katyn from Claire and was so incensed by the massacre – which claimed the life of his brother – that he set about betraying Bletchley's secrets to the Nazis in order to take revenge on Stalin. Claire is presumed dead as Jericho trails Puck to Scotland and catches up with him just as he is about to be taken on board a U-boat, but Wigram and the police have been waiting for the sub and it is bombed and sunk. A short scene after the war sees Jericho and Hester married with a child on the way. As Jericho waits for her in London, he notices Claire walking across the square.\n",

To this end, he needs the help of several former soldiers who were present when the gold was hidden. The first is Jesus , a Filipino muslim and Morrison's business associate. The second is Draco , a hard-drinking, hot-tempered Apache living on an Indian reservation who answers Morrison's telegram with the promise of finding a wartime lover named Maria Bonita.

Formerly a global sport, it was long since outlawed due to outcries of animal abuse, and instead continued in underground arenas, where the fighting became much more brutal. Despite warnings by his friend Brock , Ash takes part in the battles with his Pokémon Pikachu. When approached by Giovanni , the head of Rocket Industries, with a bribe to throw his next fight, Ash turns the offer down. In response, Giovanni threatens Ash's former mentor Professor Oak and girlfriend, Misty . Deciding to keep them safe, Ash accepts the bribe, and Pikachu is nearly killed in the match. Quickly regretting his actions, Ash revisits Giovanni and returns the bribe money, declaring himself out of the league. Enraged, Giovanni declares Ash and his friends dead, and sends his minions Jessie, James  and Meowth to carry out the retribution. As a result, Oak is killed, Pikachu and Misty are assaulted, and Brock is tortured. With the help of Pikachu, Brock and Misty, Ash goes after Giovanni and aims to take down Rocket Industries, declaring he will not stop until he has \"caught them all\".\n",

            "The year is 1936. The film is narrated by Wallau ([[Ray Collins .Seven prisoners escape from the fictitious Westhofen concentration camp near Worms, Germany near the Rhine. They represent a cross-section of German society: a writer, a circus performer, a schoolmaster, a farmer, a Jewish grocery clerk, and two prisoners who are apparently political activists. One is George Heisler  and the other his mentor Wallau , the leader of the group. The camp commandant erects a row of seven crosses and vows to \"put a man on each.\" The first to be apprehended is Wallau, who dies without giving up any information yet continues to narrate the film. The film follows Heisler as he makes his way across the German countryside , steals a jacket to cover his prison garb, and watches out, as the Nazis round up every other escaped prisoner and puts them up on the crosses, and the local population remains largely indifferent. Despite the common brutality of some of his countrymen, Heisler does receive help. Still, he is somewhat soured on the German people and humanity in general. He first makes his way to his home city of Mainz where his former girl friend, Leni, who had promised to wait for him, but has since married, refuses to help him in the slightest way, and threatens to \"report\" him; he steals a bit of her food and departs. He next witnesses the suicide leap of the cornered circus performer and then goes on to see a contact whose name he had given him, where he encounters Mme. Marelli  who gives him the outfit she was holding for the performer and slips some money into his coat pocket. Next he goes to a Jewish doctor a few doors away who had been suggested by Mme. Marelli, who treats a hand injured during his escape which had become infected. Intercut with Heisler's escape odyssey are some scenes involving some of his friends who are trying to locate and help him. When he finally reaches the home of his pre-arranged contact he finds that he has been arrested. He cannot visit his family, because they are being watched, so he goes to his old friend, Paul Roeder . Though Paul is a factory worker with a wife, Liesl , and young children, he still risks all to help Heisler. Roeder gets in touch with the German underground, whose members risk their lives to get Heisler out of the country. Through his exposure to this courage and kindness, and with the help toward the end of a sympathetic waitress  in an inn where he's hiding out and with whom he has a brief tryst and promises to send for later, Heisler regains his faith in humanity. Thanks to their help, the film ends as he approaches a cargo ship that is to take him away, \"perhaps to Holland\", with a shot of the empty seventh cross.\n",

            "A mysterious stranger, his face swathed in bandages and his eyes obscured by dark goggles, takes a room at an inn in the English village of Iping. The man demands that he be left alone. Later, the innkeeper, Mr. Hall  is sent by his wife ([[Una O'Connor  to evict him after he makes a huge mess in his room while doing research and is behind on his rent. Angered, he throws Mr. Hall down the stairs. Confronted by a policeman and some local villagers, he removes his bandages and goggles, revealing that he is invisible. Laughing maniacally, he takes off his clothes, making himself completely undetectable, and drives off his tormenters before fleeing into the countryside. The stranger is Dr. Jack Griffin , a chemist who has discovered the secret of invisibility while conducting a series of tests involving an obscure drug called \"monocane\". Flora Cranley , the daughter of Griffin's employer, Dr. Cranley , becomes distraught over Griffin's long absence, being in love with him. Cranley and his other assistant, Dr. Kemp , search Griffin's empty laboratory, finding only a single note in a cupboard. Cranley becomes concerned when he reads it. On a list of chemicals is monocane, which Cranley knows is extremely dangerous; an injection of it drove a dog mad. On the evening of his escape from the inn, Griffin turns up at Kemp's home. He forces Kemp to become his visible partner in a plot to dominate the world through a reign of terror, commencing with \"a few murders here and there\". They drive back to the inn to retrieve his notebooks on the invisibility process. Sneaking inside, Griffin finds a police inquiry underway, conducted by an official who believes it is all a hoax. After securing his books, he attacks and kills the officer. Back home, Kemp calls first Cranley, asking for help, and then the police. Flora persuades her father to let her come along. In her presence, Griffin becomes more placid and calls her \"darling.\" When he realizes Kemp has betrayed him, his first reaction is to get Flora away from danger. After promising Kemp that at 10 o'clock the next night he will murder him, Griffin escapes and goes on a killing spree. He causes the derailment of a train, resulting in a hundred deaths, and throws two volunteer searchers off a cliff. The police offer a reward for anyone who can think of a way to catch the Invisible Man. The chief detective  in charge of the search uses Kemp as bait, feeling Griffin will try to fulfill his promise, and devises various clever traps. At Kemp's insistence, the police disguise him in a police uniform and let him drive his car away from his house. Griffin, however, is hiding in the back seat of the car. He overpowers Kemp and ties him up in the front seat. Griffin then sends the car down a steep hill and over a cliff, where it explodes on impact. Griffin seeks shelter from a snowstorm in a barn. A farmer hears snoring and sees the hay, in which Griffin is sleeping, moving. The man notifies the police. The police surround the building and set fire to the barn. When Griffin comes out, the chief detective sees his footprints in the snow and opens fire, mortally wounding him. Griffin is taken to the hospital where, on his deathbed, he admits to Flora that he had tampered with something that was meant to be left alone. After he dies, his body gradually becomes visible again.\n",

            " A gang of thieves break into a high-security warehouse. An alert is sent to the police, but canceled due to unkown reasons. Two LAPD patrol officers, Hank Rafferty  and his partner Charlie Reed , decide to check it out anyway. During the investagation, Someone shoots Charlie dead, before the thieves drive away, leaving Hank in a state of shock. Earl Montgomery's  lifelong dream is to become a police officer is thwarted when Earl is expelled from the police academy after a simulated car chase results in a massive explosion. Hank crosses paths with Earl when Hank notices Earl trying to get into his car when he finds his keys stuck inside. Hank starts to question Earl, who race-baits Hank to the point of getting himself arrested. A bumblebee comes along, to which Earl is virulently allergic. Earl panics and Hank tries to swat the bee away with his nightstick. From afar, it appears as if Hank, a white cop, is brutalizing a black suspect while at the same time a Latino man catches the incident on tape. Disgraced, Hank is dismissed from the police force and convicted of aggravated assault. He spends six months in prison. After being released from prison, Hank takes a job as a security guard and continues to investigate Charlie's death. Noticing an alarm being tripped at a soft drink warehouse, then disabled, Hank goes to investigate. Meanwhile, Earl, who happens to be working for the same security company, is on duty at the warehouse, but is taking time off. When Hank arrives, he interrupts a burglary, and a gunfight erupts with the thugs, during which Hank and Earl cross paths again. Though the thugs get away, Hank recognizes the tattoo of the man who shot Charlie, whose name he learns is Nash . One of the thieves dropped a cellular phone, which leads them to a semi truck rented by the killers. Inside, Hank and Earl find a van. They drive the van out of the truck but the van falls off the bridge onto a garbage barge. Inside the van are what look like ordinary beer kegs, but Hank has them examined by a friend who works at a foundry, who informs them that the kegs are actually made of an aerospace alloy which is worth millions. Hank takes the van and the kegs to the house of his ex-girlfriend, Denise . They broke up after Hank was arrested, and Hank orders Earl to tell Denise the truth about the \"assault.\" However, when Earl sees that Denise is an attractive black woman, he forgets his promise and starts hitting on her, playing the victim again. She throws both of them out of the house, and when Hank asks for an explanation, Earl reveals that he disapproves of interracial dating. Hank is infuriated and points out that for all his talk about racism, it is actually Earl himself who is the racist. During the argument, Hank punches Earl and storms off. Earl runs back to Hank, just as they are both cornered by police, learning that they are wanted as suspects in the bridge shootout. After they manage to escape, Hank realizes that the thieves must have an inside man in the police department. Tracing the van's owner to an address Hank and Earl stake out the place, but Earl foolishly rushes inside on his own, where he is confronted by Nash. Hank manages to get Earl to safety, but Earl takes a bullet in the leg. Since the police are looking for them, they can't go to a hospital, but instead return to Denise's house. She reluctantly agrees to treat Earl's wound . Fortunately for Hank, a bee flies into the house, and Earl runs for cover, making Denise realize that Hank's outlandish story about the \"assault\" on Earl was actually true and that Earl is, in fact, the racist. She throws Earl out of the house and reconciles with Hank. Based on something overheard from Nash, they follow him to a meeting at a Yacht Club and witness him talking to McDuff, who is revealed to be the mole in the police force. Hank and Earl share everything they know with Washington , and then pretend to approach McDuff, offering to sell him back the \"beer kegs\" for a large sum of money. However, Nash gets wind of their plans and takes Washington hostage first. During the climactic confrontation, Earl and Hank meet with McDuff, Nash and his men near the coast, rescuing Washington and killing or apprehending most of the thugs, including McDuff. During the shootout, Hank saves Earl's life by warning him about a gunman taking aim at him, getting shot himself in the process. Because of this, Earl fires the rest of his clip into the gunman, killing him. Earl engages in a fist fight with Nash on an unstable slab. Though wounded, Hank takes off after Nash alone and kills him by dropping a crane load onto an unstable slab Nash is standing on, flipping him over a cliff and into the ocean. In honor of their heroic actions, Hank is reinstated in the LAPD and Earl is admitted to the force, and they are made partners a short time later. While on patrol, Hank sees a suspicious-looking man trying to break into a car, but Earl assures him that the man has just locked himself out with the keys left inside, and helps unlock the car. But as the man drives away, the car's real owner screams, and Earl, realizing his mistake, shoots the back tires out. He tells the owner she can \"re-procure\" her car, at which moment the car blows up, leaving both cops dumbfounded.\n",

            "With only four days until the bar exam, an utterly unprepared law intern, Rick Robinson , is given a rare opportunity to score points with his boss, Maxwell McAllister  and without thinking, commits to a favor he cannot afford. Rick soon finds himself stuck in a grueling cross country road trip driving a rundown U-Haul truck carrying all his boss's worldly possessions. To make matters worse, he is left in charge of Mr. McAllister's bratty Hollywood-bound niece Michelle  and her out-of-control pet pig. The trip from Miami to Los Angeles meets several snags. The truck breaks down on a backwoods road in the deep South, and Rick's clothes are burned by the hillbilly family providing them refuge for the night. Later, another breakdown results in Rick being knocked unconscious. He is rescued by a peculiar hitchhiker called Orlie , who finds a motel room for him and Michelle. Orlie asks to accompany Rick and Michelle, and is accepted, as Rick believes he owes him a favor for his rescue. Michelle takes a shine to Orlie, and they proceed to have fun at Rick's expense. After Orlie forces Rick into an unusual encounter in a fast food restaurant lavatory, Rick decides to leave him behind. He and Michelle grow closer to one another, following a stop at a Texas beach. Rick permits Michelle to drive, despite the insurance liability, due to fatigue. He wakes to find Michelle has taken them to Wichita, Kansas and Rick's home. Consequently, Rick is forced into a painful confrontation with his mentally ill father, an experience for which Michelle apologizes. They grow even closer as Michelle relates her life growing up. The pair travel to Colorado, where the truck runs out of gas. A semi in which Orlie is traveling as a passenger comes to their aid. Following a stop in a small town, the truck  is stolen by men working for local crime boss \"The Lady\" . The Lady forces Rick and Orlie to fight in a cage match before he returns the truck, impressed by the show they put on. Crossing into Utah, Orlie spots a landscape that matches a drawing in his notebook. He believes that he has switched bodies as some past moment when he was near death, and believes that the person now occupying his body will arrive here. A switch can then take place. Orlie leaves Rick and Michelle, telling them to keep going. As the window for Rick to safely arrive back in Miami for the bar exam narrows, he rejects Michelle's assertions that there is something special between them. Rick drives straight to Los Angeles, arriving in Malibu where Mr. McAllister is waiting for them at his beachside property. He states that Rick has arrived late, but does not appear overtly concerned. Realizing he must hurry to fly back to Miami, Rick rushes to the taxi McAllister has arranged for him, leaving Michelle asleep in the truck. At the airport security checkpoint, Rick realizes he is making a terrible mistake as he observes the Polaroid photos Michelle has snapped throughout their trip. Knowing he is meant to be with Michelle, he scrambles out of the airport and returns to Malibu. Finding Mr. McAllister, Rick confesses his feelings for Michelle. McAllister, having heard similar sentiments from Michelle regarding Rick, thanks him for returning and asks him to take care of her. McAllister adds that his law firm will be opening a Los Angeles branch. The movie ends as Rick reunites with Michelle on the beach, and a man approaches Orlie back in Utah.\n",

            "A mysterious stranger, his face swathed in bandages and his eyes obscured by dark goggles, takes a room at an inn in the English village of Iping. The man demands that he be left alone. Later, the innkeeper, Mr. Hall  is sent by his wife ([[Una O'Connor  to evict him after he makes a huge mess in his room while doing research and is behind on his rent. Angered, he throws Mr. Hall down the stairs. Confronted by a policeman and some local villagers, he removes his bandages and goggles, revealing that he is invisible. Laughing maniacally, he takes off his clothes, making himself completely undetectable, and drives off his tormenters before fleeing into the countryside. The stranger is Dr. Jack Griffin , a chemist who has discovered the secret of invisibility while conducting a series of tests involving an obscure drug called \"monocane\". Flora Cranley , the daughter of Griffin's employer, Dr. Cranley , becomes distraught over Griffin's long absence, being in love with him. Cranley and his other assistant, Dr. Kemp , search Griffin's empty laboratory, finding only a single note in a cupboard. Cranley becomes concerned when he reads it. On a list of chemicals is monocane, which Cranley knows is extremely dangerous; an injection of it drove a dog mad. On the evening of his escape from the inn, Griffin turns up at Kemp's home. He forces Kemp to become his visible partner in a plot to dominate the world through a reign of terror, commencing with \"a few murders here and there\". They drive back to the inn to retrieve his notebooks on the invisibility process. Sneaking inside, Griffin finds a police inquiry underway, conducted by an official who believes it is all a hoax. After securing his books, he attacks and kills the officer. Back home, Kemp calls first Cranley, asking for help, and then the police. Flora persuades her father to let her come along. In her presence, Griffin becomes more placid and calls her \"darling.\" When he realizes Kemp has betrayed him, his first reaction is to get Flora away from danger. After promising Kemp that at 10 o'clock the next night he will murder him, Griffin escapes and goes on a killing spree. He causes the derailment of a train, resulting in a hundred deaths, and throws two volunteer searchers off a cliff. The police offer a reward for anyone who can think of a way to catch the Invisible Man. The chief detective  in charge of the search uses Kemp as bait, feeling Griffin will try to fulfill his promise, and devises various clever traps. At Kemp's insistence, the police disguise him in a police uniform and let him drive his car away from his house. Griffin, however, is hiding in the back seat of the car. He overpowers Kemp and ties him up in the front seat. Griffin then sends the car down a steep hill and over a cliff, where it explodes on impact. Griffin seeks shelter from a snowstorm in a barn. A farmer hears snoring and sees the hay, in which Griffin is sleeping, moving. The man notifies the police. The police surround the building and set fire to the barn. When Griffin comes out, the chief detective sees his footprints in the snow and opens fire, mortally wounding him. Griffin is taken to the hospital where, on his deathbed, he admits to Flora that he had tampered with something that was meant to be left alone. After he dies, his body gradually becomes visible again.\n",

From afar, it appears as if Hank, a white cop, is brutalizing a black suspect while at the same time a Latino man catches the incident on tape. Disgraced, Hank is dismissed from the police force and convicted of aggravated assault. He spends six months in prison. After being released from prison, Hank takes a job as a security guard and continues to investigate Charlie's death. Noticing an alarm being tripped at a soft drink warehouse, then disabled, Hank goes to investigate. Meanwhile, Earl, who happens to be working for the same security company, is on duty at the warehouse, but is taking time off. When Hank arrives, he interrupts a burglary, and a gunfight erupts with the thugs, during which Hank and Earl cross paths again.

Both driver and passenger are taken to the hospital in an ambulance attended by intern Dr. Mike Lewis . On the way, Jane regains consciousness and claims to have amnesia; she cannot remember who she is. The driver reports this to his superiors. Mike is excited, as this is his area of study, and persuades Dr. Murdoch  to let him take the case. John Goodwin  shows up and claims Jane is his daughter. However, after he leaves, Jane tells Mike that he is lying, and that she is actually working for British Intelligence. Mike does not quite believe her, especially when Goodwin returns with a famous specialist, Dr. Ingersoll , from whom Mike took a class. When Jane adamantly refuses to go home with her \"father\", Ingersoll suggests that Mike go along to ease her mind. Jane agrees to this arrangement. In private, she tells Mike that she wants to find out as much as she can about the Nazi spy ring. Mike finds it suspicious that the Goodwin mansion is heavily staffed, and he is not permitted to go anywhere without an escort. When Steiner, a reluctant German agent, balks at kidnapping, he is kept prisoner at the mansion. He manages to pass a note to Mike, warning him that Jane is in great danger. This finally convinces Mike that she was telling the truth. Mike manages to get away, but this only confirms Ingersoll's suspicion that Jane is faking her amnesia. By the time Mike returns with Sheriff Dill, the mansion is deserted except for Ingersoll. Still trusting his old teacher, Mike accompanies him to the district attorney. Ingersoll, however, has him committed as a doctor who became too close to the psychotics he was studying. A guard offers to let Mike escape for $500, but turns out to be working for the spies; Mike ends up back in Ingersoll's hands. By threatening Mike, Ingersoll gets Jane to give him the location of a large convoy, which he passes along to a U-boat wolfpack. Mike manages to wrestle a gun away from a henchman.

He very quickly becomes surrounded by evil psychopaths, people with seemingly mild personality disorders, sarcastic guards and indifferent doctors. In a courtyard Allen has a chance meeting with Ben . Ben's outgoing pleasant nature helps to initiate a friendship with Allen who is more inclined to keep to himself. Ben's state of mind, however, fluctuates and leads to endless droning, short-term memory loss, and occasional catatonic episodes as the film progresses.

Terrorizing people gives Carl a sinister form of satisfaction. Things erupt between Carl and Allen after Carl describes some of his prior heinous acts to him.

Mia and Allen instantly fall for each other and their budding romance causes them to smile and laugh for the first time. In a tragic twist of fate, Allen and Mia's private encounter, arranged by Mrs. Standings , a sincere and caring staff member, is violently interrupted by Tarses as he attempts to escape from the hospital.\n",

            "Adolescent Kevin Katchadourian  is in prison after committing a massacre at his high school. His mother, Eva , a once-successful travel writer, lives alone in a run-down house and works in a mall travel agency in a town near the prison where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the anger and hostility of her neighbours, who know her to be Kevin's mother. Her memories are shown in flashbacks. Throughout his life Kevin has been detached and difficult. He does not bond with his mother, which affects his behavior; as a baby he cries incessantly, and as a child he resists toilet training, rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. While he is still small, Eva's frustration with his intractability drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. When Eva tries to talk to her husband, Franklin , about her increasing concern about Kevin's problems, he dismisses her concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. Their second child, Celia, is lively and cheerful. Kevin finally shows interest in something when Franklin gives him a bow and arrow set and teaches him archery; Kevin soon becomes an excellent marksman. When Celia's pet is killed and she is blinded in one eye by an incident with a caustic cleaning fluid, Eva is convinced Kevin is responsible, while Franklin insists these events were accidents and that their son is blameless. This pattern of suspicion on Eva's part and excuse on Franklin's intensifies Eva's fear of her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's pleasure in hurting others. This culminates with his plotting and executing the multiple killings of his father, Celia, his teachers, and fellow students, and his imprisonment for the crimes. The film concludes on the second anniversary of the massacre, when Eva visits Kevin in prison. Kevin is anxious because his transfer to an adult prison is imminent. Eva asks him why he committed the murders and he responds that he thought he used to know, but is no longer sure. Eva gives Kevin a hug and says her good-byes while he is taken away.\n",

            "The domineering Edwina Black has just died, and the general feeling appears to be of relief rather than grief. The local community whispers that her death is a disguised blessing for all concerned, particularly her henpecked widower Gregory  and downtrodden personal companion Elizabeth . Unknown to anybody, Gregory and Elizabeth have been clandestine lovers for some time, and matters take a serious turn when the local doctor, feeling uneasy about Edwina's sudden and unexpected death, orders an autopsy. The result come back, revealing that Edwina's body is full of arsenic. Inspector Martin  determines to get to the bottom of the case and his suspicions obviously fall on Gregory and Elizabeth. In the absence of concrete proof of their guilt, he sets out to trap them, hoping that they will inadvertently implicate themselves. A complicating factor arises when it is discovered that the housekeeper Ellen  has been keeping secrets of her own, and also had good reason for wishing Edwina ill. Two travel tickets and a guidebook to Italy are found in Elizabeth's possession. How does she explain that away? Martin proceeds to drop seemingly innocuous but loaded observations into the ears of the three suspects, hoping to provoke doubts and foster mutual suspicion. This works so well that they are soon apparently falling over themselves to incriminate each other. Martin has to try to untangle the stories to come up with a coherent picture of what actually happened, all the while being aware that he is perhaps being manipulated into barking up entirely the wrong tree.\n",

As Helen visits the hospital for a check-up, she encounters her doctor's new nurse, Jane Cronin , a single woman who is hesitant to meet someone new after getting out of a five-year relationship. She is taken by Jane's beauty, compassion, intelligence and sense of humor, and immediately decides that she is the one for her son. Helen plays matchmaker between the two of them, much to the chagrin of her longtime caretaker, Katie Beale . Tom and Jane decide to humor Helen by going out on a date, but Tom is wrong in assuming that Jane likes him. In turn, Jane tells Helen that her date was \"the worst social experience since the dawn of man.\" Undeterred, Helen manages to convince Jane to go out with Tom again. The second date goes successfully, but this time, Tom is afraid to commit because he feels he isn't the kind of man Jane's looking for. Helen succeeds in making her son see Jane again by employing jealousy, but just as things are going well between the couple, she learns that her cancer is back. This fuels her determination to finally get Tom to settle down with Jane, which frustrates Katie into telling her that she is meddling so much with her son's life that she is not allowing him to move on and live it on his own. Meanwhile, a torn-apart Tom goes back to his old ways and meets a girl at a bar who he reluctantly takes home with him. Jane encounters the girl and flees Tom immediately. Tom becomes withdrawn and depressed, not only because of Jane, but also because of his mother's illness. Meanwhile, as Helen's condition worsens, she begins to realize that she is not going to be around forever to look after her son.\n",

            "On a stormy night in March 1980, a distraught Jean Harris arrives at the baronial Purchase, New York home of Herman Tarnower following a five-hour drive from McLean, Virginia. Her goal is to commit suicide beside the pond on his estate after confronting her former lover, who spurned her in favor of his considerably younger secretary-receptionist Lynne Tryforos. When she removes a gun from her handbag, Tarnower attempts to take it away from her, and in the struggle he accidentally is shot and collapses. Because the phone isn't working, Jean drives off to seek help from a neighbor, only to return to the house when she sees a police car heading in that direction. The film then follows divergent paths, using flashbacks and flashforwards to tell the story of the couple's initial meeting, their evolving and eventually faltering relationship, the night of the shooting, and Jean's consequent trial for murder. A divorced mother of two sons, she tends to be complacent in both her personal and professional lives, the ideal target for Herman, a vulgar man with the need to be in total control of everyone and everything. He proposes marriage and presents Jean with a ring she feels is embarrassingly large and overly gaudy for the headmistress of a private girls' school. As time passes, she presses him to set a wedding date, until he finally confesses he has changed his mind about marrying her, primarily because he has no interest in playing the role of father to her sons. Jean attempts to return the ring but he insists she keep it and, instead of allowing her to make a clean break from the relationship, he continues to manipulate her by taking advantage of her need for a dominant presence in her life. By prescribing numerous medications to which she becomes addicted, he forces her to become both physically and emotionally dependent upon him while flaunting his many affairs with other women. During Jean's trial, a flashback to the night of the shooting shows it in a very different light from the earlier portrayal. An angry Jean willfully and methodically shoots Herman and coldly watches him writhe in pain, but on the witness stand she insists it was an accident. Her staunch refusal to allow attorney Joel Aurnou to portray her former lover in a bad light prevents him from presenting any details that would support a defense of extreme emotional disturbance, and she is found guilty and sentenced to fifteen years to life in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County.\n",

            " Humble and devout Muharrem lives in a solitary and meager existence of prayer and sexual abstinence. His extraordinary devotion attracts the attention of the Sheikh of an Istanbul Sufi order who offers him an administrative post as a manager for the seminary properties that support a school for orphans and poor children. Muharrem's new job throws him into the modern outside world he has not experienced before. He soon witnesses conflicting attitudes and dilemmas towards alcohol, charity and honesty. He notices that he himself has become proud, domineering and even dishonest. To make matters worse, Muharrem's inner peace is unnerved by the tormenting image of a seductive woman who tempts him in his dreams, both night and day. With the balance of his devotion now upset, his fear of God begins to eat away at his senses. He remains steadfast seeking forgiveness from Allah and guidance from his Sheikh in whom he has complete faith. The Sheikh is portrayed as evidence of how power can corrupt. Throughout the story the Sheikh guides Muharrem on the mystical path, however, Muharrem is confused by the Sheikh's uncharitable insistence that rent is collected from everyone, even those who cannot pay. When Muharrem faces his greatest spiritual crises, the Sheikh, being on retreat, is unavailable to counsel him. However, it is possible as seeing the actions of the Sheikh as pushing his fuqarat  beyond his comfortable monastic boundaries. The teacher may have given Muharrem this test to help him to grow and as a test of his character. There is a saying along the lines of 'Money will reveal a person's true character, if they are generous, they will be more so, if they are greedy, it will be apparent'. Muharrem, at first, is fair with money. He has compassion for the family that cannot pay their rent. When he is pushed by the Sheikh to collect from everyone, even those who cannot pay, a shift happens as he is faced with the crisis of following his inner voice and the directions of his beloved Sheikh. The film ends with him experiencing an excellently portrayed crisis of spirit, driven by his inner piousness clashing against the jarring change he sees in himself, brought upon by his new job that thrust him unprepared into the modern world. He ends up catatonic in bed, being cared for by the woman of his dreams, yet completely oblivious to her presence.\n",

            "Sridhar Vasudevan  is a middle-class family man employed in a bank. Sridhar is very idealistic, principled and recognises a deep sense of belonging with the society he is part of. He gets annoyed and flustered by illegal and semi legal activities happening around him. His wife persistently demands that he should be more 'flexible' and make more money, but Sridhar does not accede. He endures the illegal and semi legal activities around him because he anticipates a change in the mindsets of people. He feels that over time, they will become more honest, socially aware and willing to make small personal sacrifices for the greater good of all . Sridhar's wife Vatsala  is a typical middle-class housewife and a caring mother of two children, Varsha and Varun. Societal imperfections and related problems matter very little to her. She is more concerned about her reactive husband, thinking about ways to save him from the effects of his angry outbursts and to steer him away from his impractical thoughts and deeds. At a certain point in life, Sridhar faces a case of deceit that compels him to take action. Provoked by his deep anger and guilt, Sridhar decides to retaliate for wrongs done to him, violently if required. When charged two rupees extra for a cool drink, he picks up a cricket bat and smashes the shop. From that incident onwards, Sridhar progresses, taking the law in his own hands and tries bringing about instant changes, wherever needed. A string of incidents occur; he thrashes the Area Counseller, the insincere hospital employees, water-supplier and many more. Sridhar's anger goes beyond these incidents, targeting individuals who do not follow norms created for their own benefit. The director has presented Sridhar as a representative for every common man in today's society, who, even after seeing and going through such wrong things, tolerates them to avoid getting his settled routine disturbed. Because of his behaviour and approach, Sridhar is termed as a criminal, harmful to his fellow men. Inspector Vetri Maran  is appointed to shoot him in an arranged 'encounter'. Vetri Maran, though not of the incorruptible kind, feels bad about the police-corruption nexus. He is a good-hearted cop, and inwardly feels justified by Sridhar's approach. He comes to a quiet agreement with the young man, personally approves his action, then arranges for the 'encounter killing'. At the end Sridhar  is shot dead by the Inspector Vetri Maran .\n",

            "Johnny  is a successful banker who lives in a San Francisco townhouse with his fiancée, Lisa . They share an intense relationship characterized by constant, passionate lovemaking. Despite this idyllic existence, Lisa has inexplicably become dissatisfied with her life, and one afternoon confides to her best friend Michelle  and her mother Claudette  that she finds Johnny boring. Although Michelle advises her to be grateful for what she has, and her mother counsels her that financial stability is more important than happiness, Lisa decides to seduce Johnny's best friend, Mark . Although he is initially reluctant, Mark gives in to Lisa's advances. Their affair continues through the remainder of the film, even though Mark appears reluctant at the outset of each sexual encounter and repeatedly tries to break off the relationship. Lisa, meanwhile, having come to the realization that she \"wants it all,\" decides to stay with Johnny for financial support and the material goods he can provide her. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa alternates between glorifying and vilifying Johnny to her family and friends, both making false accusations of domestic abuse and defending Johnny against criticisms. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confess her infidelity to her mother, attaches a tape recorder to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover. Against the backdrop of Lisa and Mark's affair, numerous subplots involving secondary characters begin to develop: Denny , a neighboring college student whom Johnny financially supports and \"loves like a son,\" has a mysterious run-in with a drug dealer named Chris-R , whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take to the police. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing his attraction to Johnny; once Johnny tells Denny that Lisa loves him as her friend, Denny resolves to propose to his own girlfriend. Johnny takes on a mysterious client at his bank whose identity he is sworn to protect. Claudette experiences real estate problems, bemoans failed relationships, and informs Lisa that she has breast cancer. Michelle and her boyfriend, Mike , sneak into Johnny and Lisa's home to have sex. Peter , a psychologist friend of Johnny's and Mark's, alternates between defending Lisa and assessing her as a sociopath, which results in Mark briefly trying to murder him. Each of these subplots receive little exposition, and none are ever resolved. At Johnny's surprise party, Steven , a previously unseen friend of Lisa's and Johnny's, catches Lisa kissing Mark while the rest of the guests are outside and confronts her about the affair. Lisa expresses no remorse, while Mark angrily urges Steven not to tell anyone. Johnny announces to the guests that Lisa is pregnant, only for Lisa to tell Steven and Michelle that she lied about it in order to \"make it interesting.\" At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who physically attacks Mark. After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom, prompting Lisa to make plans to leave him for Mark. Johnny finally comes out of the bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone, and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Claiming that all of his friends have betrayed him, Johnny destroys his apartment and then kills himself with a pistol. Denny, Mark, and Lisa discover Johnny's body sometime later. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark declaring he doesn't love Lisa. Denny asks to be left alone with the body, but Lisa and Mark instead decide to stay and comfort one another as the sound of sirens grows louder.{{cite web|urlMotion Picture Purgatory: The Room |publisher2009-12-10 |accessdateInconsistencies and narrative flaws\"pm1\">Portland Mercury article: \"/> The issue is casually dismissed and never revisited during the rest of the film.

Despite Sally's lack of interest, Joe's infatuation with her develops into obsession. Meanwhile a regular client at the salon, young gentleman farmer Harry , begins to woo Sally, who is much more receptive to his attentions. The couple begin seeing each other, and one evening arrange to go to the local cinema.

Η δημιουργία της W2V αναπαράστασης χρειάζεται γύρω στα 30 δεύτερα στα embeddings που χρησιμοποιήσαμε παραπάνω. (+ το χρόνο για το preprocessing & download των embeddings. Σαφώς δεν χρειάζεται να κάνουμε αυτή τη διαδικασία πάντα) Συνολικά δημιουργείται ένα coprus με αρκετά μικρότερο μέγεθος από ό,τι η tf-idf αναπαράσταση. (Από ~ 5000x15000 οδηγούμαστε σε dataset με shape 5000x200) Παρά τη μεγάλη συμπίεση, δεν χάνουμε σε \"επίδοση\" από τον tf-idf.

        "- Για την ομαδοποίηση ένα U-matrix καλό είναι να εμφανίζει και μπλε-πράσινες περιοχές (clusters) και κόκκινες περιοχές (ορίων). Παρατηρήστε ποια σχέση υπάρχει μεταξύ αριθμού ταινιών στο final set, μεγέθους grid και ποιότητας U-matrix.\n",
        "- Για το k του k-Means προσπαθήστε να προσεγγίζει σχετικά τα clusters του U-matrix (όπως είπαμε είναι διαφορετικοί μέθοδοι clustering). Μικρός αριθμός k δεν θα σέβεται τα όρια. Μεγάλος αριθμός θα δημιουργεί υπο-clusters εντός των clusters που φαίνονται στο U-matrix. Το τελευταίο δεν είναι απαραίτητα κακό, αλλά μεγαλώνει τον αριθμό clusters που πρέπει να αναλυθούν σημασιολογικά.\n",
        "- Σε μικρούς χάρτες και με μικρά final sets δοκιμάστε διαφορετικές παραμέτρους για την εκπαίδευση του SOM. Σημειώστε τυχόν παραμέτρους που επηρεάζουν την ποιότητα του clustering για το dataset σας ώστε να τις εφαρμόσετε στους μεγάλους χάρτες.\n",
        "- Κάποια τοπολογικά χαρακτηριστικά εμφανίζονται ήδη σε μικρούς χάρτες. Κάποια άλλα χρειάζονται μεγαλύτερους χάρτες. Δοκιμάστε μεγέθη 20x20, 25x25 ή και 30x30 και αντίστοιχη προσαρμογή των k. Όσο μεγαλώνουν οι χάρτες, μεγαλώνει η ανάλυση του χάρτη αλλά μεγαλώνει και ο αριθμός clusters που πρέπει να αναλυθούν.\n"

        "Ύστερα από πειράματα, καταλήγουμε στο ότι το καλύτερο πλέγμα SOM έχει 30 νευρώνες, είναι επίπεδο και ορθογωνικό, με τυχαία αρχικοποίηση βαρών και γκαουσσιανή γειτονιά. Γίνεται χρήση 20 clusters, καθώς θεωρούμε ότι τα 25 clusters είναι πολλά αν λάβουμε υπόψη τα κυρίαρχα είδη ταινίας (δηλαδή με 25 θα εμφανίζεται πολλές φορές το ίδιο κύριο είδος, σε πολλά clusters, με μικρές διαφορές στα λιγότερο κυρίρχα).\n",
        "\n",
        "Το πρώτο που επιβεβαιώνουμε είναι ότι τα πιο συχνά είδη ταινίας στην είσοδο απασχολούν πολλούς νευρώνες. Το είδος Drama που είναι το πιο συχνό με 13% εμφάνισης στις ταινίες περιέχεται σχεδόν σε όλα τα clusters. Για παράδειγμα το `cid = 3` είναι το κύριο cluster δράματος απασχολώντας 136 νευρώνες, που είναι σχεδόν το διπλάσιο από το επόμενο μεγαλύτερο cluster. Στα `cid = 16, 4, 12, 15` είναι το πιο συχνό είδος, ενώ στα `cid = 5, 8, 17, 10` το δεύτερο πιο συχνό. Παρόμοια είναι η εικόνα για το Comedy (7%). Αντιθέτως, στο cluster `15` όπου έχουν μαζευτεί όλες οι Chinese Movies, 110 εμφανίσεις με 0.63%, είναι το cluster με τους λιγότερους νευρώνες (21).\n",
        "\n",
        "Έχουμε να παρατηρήσουμε ότι τα μακρινά πρότυπα πράγματι απέχουν στον χάρτη. Για παράδειγμα, τα Documentary ανήκουν στο cluster με `cid = 1` και τα περισσότερα Zombie films ανήκουν στο cluster `13`, τα πρώτα βρίσκονται κοντά στη μέση τη U-matrix ενά τα δεύτερα στην κάτω αριστερή γωνία απομονωμένα. Πιο πολύ από τα Zombie films απέχει το cluster `8` με τις ρομαντικές ταινίες (Romance Films) που βρίσκεται στην πάνω δεξιά γωνία, πράγμα αναμενόμενο.\n",
        "\n",
        "Αντίστοιχα, τα κοντινά πρότυπα είναι γενικά μαζί στον χάρτη: Πηγαίνοντας από την κάτω αριστερή γωνία προς το κέντρο του U-matrix, μετά τις ταινίες με zombie βρίσκεται το cluster `19` που αφορά ταινίες τρόμου (Thriller, Horror). Σαν δεύτερο παράδειγμα, το `cid = 12` όπου το κύριο είδος είναι το δράμα με υποείδη τις ταινίες πολέμου και πολιτικής βρίσκεται κοντά στο κύριο cluster του δράματος (`cid = 3`). Σαν τρίτο παράδειγμα, το cluster `10` με υποείδος Comedy-drama έχει κύρια είδη Comedy και Drama.\n",

Ένα μικρό παρόμοιο cluster είναι το `16`: περίεχει κυρίως Drama, Comedy και Romance Films, αλλά και Japanese Movies, Action, Horror. Ενδεχομένως, αυτό το cluster αναφέρται σε ταινίες που είναι κατά βάση ρομαντικές αλλά περιέχουν και σκηνές δράσης.\n",
        "\n",
        "Η ασάφεια παρατηρείται και μεταξύ των clusters. Για παράδειγμα, το cluster `1` που αφορά Ντοκιμαντέρ βρίσκεται δίπλα στο cluster με τις ταινίες Western, `2`. Ερμηνεία: Εφόσον οι Western ταινίες διαδραματίζονται σε παλαιά εποχή, έχει ιστορική αξία ο τρόπος ζωής των ανθρώπων τότε, παρόλο που οι σκηνές επικεντρώνονται στη δράση.\n",

        "\n",
        "Τέλος, αξίζει να αναφέρουμε τις παρατηρήσεις μας από τις διαφορετικές παραμέτρους στο SOM. Παρατηρήσαμε ότι η τοροειδής τοπολογία δεν παράγει αισθητή βελτίωση, το ανάποδο μάλιστα, καθώς στις δοκιμές μας ομαδοποιεί το κύριο cluster από το είδος ταινίας Documentary με πολλά Thriller. Αντιθέτως, ο εξαγωνικός χάρτης διαχωρίζει πολύ καλά τα Documentary, αλλά ο τρόπος που το Somoclu εμφανίζει το U-matrix αποτρέπει την ερμηνεία (βλ. παράδειγμα στην επόμενη εικόνα), για αυτόν τον λόγο δεν έγινε εκτενής μελέτη του. Ομοίως, η γειτονιά Bubble εμφανίζει περισσότερα κόκκινα σημεία στον χάρτη και είδαμε ότι το Documentary ομαδοποιείται με το Comedy, πράγμα ανεπιθύμητο. Η αρχικοποίηση PCA δε βλετιώνει τη γειτονιά Bubble διότι εμφανίζει U-matrix με πολλές κόκκινες περιοχές. Γενικά, η PCA βελτίωσε το τοροειδές πλέγμα, αλλά φαίνεται πως δυσκόλεψε τον διαχωρισμό των ειδών μετάξυ τους.\n",

Έτσι, δεν αξίζει να ασχοληθούμε με αυτό, παρόλο που διαχώρισε πλήρως την κατηγορία των Ντοκιμαντέρ στις εκτελέσεις μας (ελέγχθηκε με τη `neuron_movies_report()`).*"
